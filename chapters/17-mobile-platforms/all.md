## Android

### Device Administration API

- Provides device administration features at the system level
- This API allows to create security-aware apps that are useful in the enterprise settings, where require rich control over employee devices

### Rooting

- A process of allowing user to attain privileged control
- Needed for modify settings, get full control over the kernel or install custom ROMs
- E.g. [SuperOneClick](https://www.malavida.com/en/soft/superoneclick/) allows to root Android phones.

## iOS

### Jailbreaking

- Rooting the iOS
- Escalating the privileges on iOS to remove or bypass the factory default restrictions

#### Jailbreaking exploits

- **Userland exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level access without escalating iBoot-level access
- **iBoot exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level and boot-level access
- **BootROM exploit**
  - üìù Allow user-level and boot-level access

#### Jailbreaking Techniques

##### Untethered jailbreak

- Does not require to reboot with a connection to your computer
- Exploit bypass the iBoot sequence

##### Tethered jailbreak

- Need a connection to your computer to reboot, without it, the boot stuck with an Apple logo
- Offers complete jailbreak features

##### Semi-Untethered jailbreak

- Allows to boot into the iOS device, but with limited functionality
- The jailbreak functions will be disabled until the launch of a jailbreak app

#### Semi-Tethered jailbreak

- Allows you to boot with limited functionality
- To get the full functionality, a reboot with a tethered jailbreak required
- Tethered jailbreak + a package to allow reboot with limited functionality
- ‚ùó A reboot no longer retains the patched kernel
  - But the installed jailbreaking tool can be used if admin privileges are required.

#### Cloud-based MDM Deployment

- MDM application is installed and maintained by a third party
- Less administration needed
- The deployment and maintenance is the responsibility of the service provider

### Bring Your Own Device (BYOD)

BYOD is a trend of employees using their personal devices for work. It could be a laptop, a phone, etc...

#### BYOD Policies

BYOD policies should include:

- Device: which devices and operating systems are supported
- Password: require all devices to be password protected
- Access: determine which data can be accessed from employee's device
- Application: which applications allowed, which should be banned

## Mobile security guidelines

- Avoid auto-upload of files
