## Firewall evasion techniques

- [Source routing](../03-scanning-networks/bypassing-ids-and-firewall.md#source-routing) to avoid the route of the firewall

### Using fragmented packets

- The idea is to split up the TCP header over several packets to make it harder
- E.g. `-f` command in `nmap`: `nmap -f 192.168.1.12`
  - utilizes 16 bytes per fragment which diminishes the number of fragments
  - to specify own offset size: `nmap --mtu 16 192.168.1.12`
- ‚ùó Most modern firewall and IDS detect fragmented packets.

### Firewalking

- üìù Discovers firewall rules using traceroute-like technique with IP TTL expiration
- Works by sending out TCP or UDP packets with a TTL one greater than the targeted gateway
  - Tests if gateway allows the traffic to find firewalls
- Requires knowledge of:
  1. Known gateway (can be firewall) before the host (serves as waypoint)
  2. IP address of a host located behind the firewall.
- ‚ùó If a host on the other side of the firewall cannot be targeted then firewalking will not be successful
- Also known as ***port knocking***
  - Externally opening ports on a firewall by generating a connection attempt on a set of prespecified closed ports
- **Tools**
  - [`firewall` script](https://Nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/firewalk.html) in `nmap`: e.g. `nmap --traceroute --script=firewalk --script-args=firewalk.max-probed-ports=-1 192.168.3.11`
  - [Firewall tool](http://packetfactory.openwall.net/projects/firewalk/index.html) e.g. `firewalk 192.168.1.2 192.168.3.11`
    - Responses can be interpreted as:
      - **`ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED`**: Gateway forwards packets to next hop where they're expired.
      - **No response**: Port is probably blocked
- **Countermeasures**
  - Use Network Address Translation to hide the addresses on your internal networks
  - Block all outgoing TTL Exceeded in Transit packets in the firewall

### HTTP and ICMP tunneling

- Can be used to bypass firewalls rules through obfuscation of the actual traffic
- Works by injecting arbitrary data into packets sent to a remote computer
- Hard to detect without proper deep packet inspection or log review
- HTTP tunneling (port 80) is almost never filtered by a firewall.

### DNS tunneling

- Also known as **TCP over DNS**
- Provides a TCP tunnel through the standard DNS protocol
- Used to evade firewalls as most firewalls allow DNS traffic to freely pass into and out of the network.
- ü§óüí° May browsing internet in coffee shops for free
- Tools include ‚Ä¢ [iodine](https://github.com/yarrick/iodine) ‚Ä¢ [ThunderDNS](https://github.com/fbkcs/ThunderDNS)

## Banner grabbing

- Used to identify firewalls.
- Tools
  - Using [Nmap banner script](https://Nmap.org/nsedoc/scripts/banner.html) `nmap -sV --script=banner <target-ip>`
  - Using [`netcat`](./../03-scanning-networks/banner-grabbing.md#netcat): `nc -v -n 192.168.51.129 21`

## Obfuscation

### Path obfuscation

| Type |¬†Clear-text |¬†Obfuscated-text |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Self-referencing directories | `/etc/passwd` | `/etc/./passwd` |
| Double slashes | `/etc//passwd` | `/etc/passwd` |
| Path traversal | `/etc/passwd` | `/etc/dummy/../passwd` |
| Windows folder separator | `../../cmd.exe` | `..\..\cmd.exe` |
| IFS (Unix shells) | `/etc/passwd` | `CMD=X/bin/catX/etc/passwd;eval$CMD` |

### URL encoding

- E.g. `http://cloudarchitecture.io/paynow.php?p=attack` becomes `http://cloudarchitecture.io/paynow.php?p=%61%74%74%61%63%6B`
- **Null-byte attacks**
  - Evasion technique and attack at the same time (to get unauthorized access to server files)
  - Effective against applications
    - developed using C-based languages
    - using native file manipulation
  - Can be done by appending `%00`

### Unicode encoding

#### Unicode

- Provides unique identifier for every character in every language
- Facilitates uniform computer representation of the world's languages
- Each character can be represented by U+xxxx where x is a hexadecimal digit.

#### Unicode encoding attack

- Also known as **UTF-8 encoding**
- Presenting information in an unusual way to confuse the signature-based IDS
- üìù A very common way to evade IDS
- E.g. instead of `http://vulneapplication/../../appusers.txt` using `http://vulneapplication/%C0AE%C0AE%C0AF%C0AE%C0AE%C0AFappusers.txt`

### Encryption

- üìù Most effective evasion attack
- IDS becomes unable to analyze packets going through these encrypted communications
- E.g. [SSH](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell), [SSL](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ssl-secure-sockets-layer)/[TLS](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#tls-transport-layer-security), or [OpenVPN](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#openvpn) tunnel

### Polymorphism

- Using polymorphic shellcode to create unique network patterns to evade signature detection
- E.g. by encoding payload by XORing and putting the decoder in the start of the payload where the target runs the decoder when it executes the code
- Tools include [ADMMutate](https://github.com/K2/ADMMutate): A shellcode mutation engine, can evade NIDS

## Denial of service

- If IDS fails, it allows the traffic to go through
- Passive IDSes are vulnerable as they are fail-open.
- E.g.
  - by exploiting a bug in the IDS, consuming all of the computational resources on the IDS
  - deliberately triggering a large number of alerts to disguise the actual attack.

## False positive generation

- Also known as ***flooding*** or ***false-positive generation***
- üìù Designed to create a great deal of log noise in an attempt to blend real attacks with the false
- Attackers craft packets known to trigger alerts within the IDS, forcing it to generate a large number of false reports
- Similar to the DoS method is to generate a large amount of alert data that must be logged
- Make is difficult legitimate attacks and false positives by looking at logs
- Can even generate false positives specific to an IDS if attacker has knowledge of IDS used.
- Tools include [inundator](http://inundator.sourceforge.net/): intrusion detection false positives generator.

## Insertion attack

- Exploited by sending packets to an end-system that it will reject but IDS will think are valid.
- By doing this the attacker is ***inserting*** data into the IDS
- Allows attacker to defeat signature analysis and to slip attacks past an IDS.
- An IDS can accept a packet that an end-system rejects.
  - also misbelieving that the end-system has accepted and processed the packet
- As signature analysis use pattern-matching in a stream of data to detect strings.
  - E.g. IDS can easily detect `phf` in HTTP request.
    - But the attacker insert data and make it look like e.g. `pleasdontdetectthisforme` where only `phf` part is sent to the original stream.
- A countermeasure would be making IDS as strict as an end-system to minimize this attacks
  - however it then allows for evasion attacks.

## Session splicing

- Splits the attack traffic in to many packets such that no single packet triggers the IDS.
- Network level attack
- ‚ùó Not the same as [IP fragmentation](../03-scanning-networks/bypassing-ids-and-firewall.md#packet-fragmentation)
  - Session splicing concerns just HTTP payload in chunks to prevent string matches by IDS.
- Send parts of the request in different packets
  - E.g. `"GET / HTTP/1.0"` may be split across multiple packets to be
    - `"GE"`, `"T "`, `"/"`, `" H"`, `"T"`, `"TP"`, `"/1"`, `".0"`
- Tools include [Nessus](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#nessus) or [Whisker](#whisker)

## Tools

- [`fragroute`](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/fragroute) for [packet fragmentation](../03-scanning-networks/bypassing-ids-and-firewall.md#packet-fragmentation)
- Different scanners such as `nmap` has also [options to evade IDS](https://Nmap.org/book/subvert-ids.html#avoid-ids).
- Also many web vulnerability scanners can be used such as [Nikto](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#nikto)], [Whisker](#whisker) and [Nessus](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#nessus)

### Whisker

- Also known as `libwhisker`
- Open-source [perl module](https://sourceforge.net/projects/whisker/) for HTTP-related functions, including vulnerability scanning and exploitation.
- üìù Helps also to evade IDS with [session splicing](#session-splicing) and tactics including:

  | Name |¬†Explanation/Example |
  | ---- | ------------------ |
  | Method matching | GET -> HEAD |
  | URL encoding | HEX %xx notation |
  | Double slashes | `/` -> `//` |
  | Reverse traversal | `/dir/blahblah/../` |
  | Self-reference directories | `/dir/./././././ == /dir/` |
  | Premature request ending | stop at the first `HTTP/1.?\r\n` |
  | Parameter hiding | `%3f` -> `?` |
  | HTTP mis-formatting | `%20` -> `%09 (TAB)` |
  | Long Urls | `GET /<random>/../dir/a.cgi` |
  | DOS/Win directory syntax | `'/'` -> `\` |
  | NULL method processing | `GET\0` |
  | Case sensitivity | `'abc' -> 'ABC` |
# Firewall overview

- Monitors network traffic and allows or blocks traffic based on a defined set of rules
- Predefined rules ensure only allowed incoming and outgoing traffic can pass through.
- Gateway/filter between two networks usually between private and public (internet)

## Firewall architecture

### Multi-homed firewalls

- Also known as ***multi-homed hosts***, ***multihomed hosts***, ***multi homed hosts***, ***multi homed firewalls*** or ***multihomed firewalls***.
- üìù A host / firewall that has more than single network interface (NIC)
- Each interface are connected to separate network segments

### Dual-homed firewalls

- Dual-home can be a proxy, gateway, firewall etc.
- A special case of [bastion hosts](#bastion-hosts).
- Allows them to transfer data between the two networks
- Has two interfaces
  - External or public, usually to untrusted network such as Internet
  - Internal or private, usually to trusted network such as Intranet
- **Screened Host**
  - Firewall architecture where two filters are used
  - ![Screened host firewall architecture](img/screened-host-firewall.png)

#### Bastion hosts

- Mediates traffic between inside and outside networks
- Designed and configured (hardened) to withstand attacks
- Usually hosts a single service e.g. a proxy server

### Screened subnet firewalls

- Screen subnet is also known as **DMZ** or **perimeter network**.
- Used to secure servers that are accessible from the internet.
- Consists of three zones:
  1. External (e.g. to internet)
  2. üìù Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)
     - Placed in-between internal (trusted) and external (untrusted) network
     - Usually where bastions are placed
  3. Private (to internal network e.g. intranet)
- ![Screened subnet firewall architecture](img/screened-subnet-firewall.png)
- Two routers
  1. External router separating traffic from a perimeter network (DMZ)
  2. Internal router separating perimeter from internal network
- Can be achieved through either
  - Single firewall with three interfaces
    - See also [zone-based firewall](#zone-based-firewall)
  - Three different firewalls
    - üí° Better as compromising one won't compromise all

## Firewall categories

- **Hardware Firewall**
  - Device placed on the network's perimeter
  - Uses packet filtering technique to filter the traffic
  - Can be a standalone device or part of a router
- **Software Firewall**
  - Filters traffic on the installed machine
  - Protects its host from unauthorized access, trojans, viruses, and worms.

### Software vs Hardware firewalls

| Attribute |¬†Hardware firewall |¬†Software firewall |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Price | More expensive | Cheaper |
| Maintainability | Hard | Easy |
| Speed |¬†Faster response time |¬†Slower response times |
|¬†Interference | Minimal, can easily remove/replace etc. |¬†Difficult to uninstall |

## Firewall types per OSI Layer

- üìù Technologies used per OSI layer

  | OSI Layer | Firewall technologies |
  | --------- | --------------------- |
  | 7. Application | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) ‚Ä¢ Application Proxies ‚Ä¢ Web Application Firewall (WAF) ‚Ä¢  Request filtering based on headers and payload |
  | 6. Presentation | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) |
  | 5. Session | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) ‚Ä¢ Circuit-level gateway |
  | 4. Transport | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) ‚Ä¢ Packet filtering based on port numbers |
  | 3. Network | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) ‚Ä¢ Network Address Translation (NAT) ‚Ä¢ Packet filtering, Stateful multilayer inspection |
  |¬†2. Data Link | ‚Ä¢ Virtual Private Network (VPN) ‚Ä¢ Packet filtering |

- üìù All vulnerabilities in one layer is independent of the other layer.
  - E.g. cross-site scripting (application layer) vulnerable application would be vulnerable to it regardless of any protection on other layers.
  - Also vulnerabilities exist at network layers would not be visible to a stateful
- üí° In most cases, you'd use both a L3 and an L7 firewall and the two complement each other.
- See also [OSI model](./../03-scanning-networks/tcpip-basics.md#osi-model)

### Packet filtering firewalls

- Implemented on the Network Layer, usually part of routers
- Designed to analyze each packet individually to apply a set of filters
- üìù Examines the packets headers for source, destination, protocol, destination port, flags..
- Packet is dropped (not forwarded to its destination) if it does not comply with the predefined rules
- üìù Can be [stateful](#stateful-firewalls) (mostly, newer) or stateless (older).
- Ineffective in preventing Web Application attacks as port 80 and 443 would not be blocked.

#### Access Control Lists (ACLs)

- Usually packet filtering rules are defined using ACLs (access control lists)
- Known also **Wireless Access Control List (WACL)** as in wireless routers.
- üìù Type of rule-based access control
- üìù E.g.
  - In Linux using [iptables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables), disable all incoming SSH using `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP`
  - In Windows it's controlled with `netsh advfirewall` (older: `netsh firewall`)
  - E.g. on [Cisco routers](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/ios-firewall/23602-confaccesslists.html) using `access-list 101 deny tcp any host 100.100.100.1 eq 22`
    - where `101` is sequence number that helps with ordering of the rules
      - the lower the number is the higher priority it gets in the ordering
    - ACL are processed in top down meaning if a condition is met all processing is stopped.

#### Packet inspection

##### Port-based classification

- E.g. TCP 80 = HTTP
- Old way, today it's useless as assumptions can be wrong

##### QoS markers (DSCP)

- Similar to port-based but based on QoS tags for prioritization
- Ignored as it's easy to cheat and forge

##### Statistical traffic classification

- Based on manual rules or ML (machine learning) dataset
- Hard to create a good dataset and poor accuracy for cases outside of the set

##### Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

- Inspecting packet payload
- Encrypted payload (e.g. HTTPS) ensures privacy and confidentiality
- Can see DNS query name, HTTP Host/Server fields and SSL/QUIC SNI (Server Name Indication)
- Important for cloud applications sharing same IPs
- Used in e.g. state censorship, and cloud-generation firewalls
- Tools: [ntop](https://github.com/ntop/ntopng) that's based on [nDPI](https://github.com/ntop/nDPI)

#### Stateful firewalls

- Also known as ***stateful inspection firewalls***
  - Stateful inspection is also known as **dynamic packet filtering**
- Keeps state of open connections.
- When a packet arrives, its header is examined to determine if it belongs to an already established connection.
- If it belongs to a connection, then it's allowed to go through
- Analyzed against defined set of rules to determine if connection is allowed to flow through
- E.g. will filter `ACK` without [TCP connection](./../03-scanning-networks/tcpip-basics.md#three-way-handshake) establishment (with `SYN`)

##### Zone-based firewall

- ![Illustration showing different zones in a zone-based firewall](img/zone-based-firewall.png)
- Type of [stateful](#stateful-firewalls) network and [multi-homed](#multi-homed-firewalls) firewalls.
- Allows setting up rules such to filter / inspect traffic between zones.

###### Firewall zone

- Logical area in which the devices having same trust levels resides.
- An interface is assigned to a zone.
- By default, traffic is not allowed from one zone to another.
- Common zones
  - **Private**: inside | Most trusted network
  - **Public**: outside | Untrusted network
  - **DMZ (demilitarized)**: neutral | Sits in-between private and outside

#### firewalld

- Zone-based network level firewall on Linux
- Rules can be
  - **Runtime**: For duration of the session
  - **Permanent**: Persists through reboot or reload of a firewall
    - ‚ùó Requires `firewall-cmd --reload` to apply the rules.
- Commands:
  - Install: `yum install firewalld`
  - Start: `systemctl start firewalld`
  - Add rule (allow access): `firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp`
  - Remove rule (deny access): `firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --remove-port=80/tcp`
  - Reload to apply changed rules: `firewall-cmd --reload`
  - Block access from different countries through geo IP block
    1. Download ip blocks at e.g. [ipdeny.com](https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/)
       1. Download: `wget https://www.ipdeny.com/ipblocks/data/countries/all-zones.tar.gz`
       2. Extract: `tar -vxzf all-zones.tar.gz`
    2. Create a list called e.g. `blacklist`: `firewall-cmd --permanent --new-ipset=blacklist --type=hash:net --option-family=inet`
       - `--type`: `hash` is the storage type, `:net` is to block whole subnet
       - `--inet`: ipv4
    3. Add entries to list: `firewall-cmd --permanent --ipset=blacklist --add-entries-from-file=us.zone`
    4. Apply entries in list
       - Deny access: `firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=drop --add-source=ipset:blacklist`
       - `firewall-cmd --reload`
- In `/etc/firewall/firewall.d` file you can e.g. enable logging for denied traffic.
  - üí° Careful for what you log as they can grow rapidly as servers, web applications etc. are also logging.

### Circuit level gateway firewalls

- Also known as **circuit-level gateway**
- üìù Monitors TCP handshakes to determine if the requested connection is legitimate.
- üìù Implemented on
  - OSI model: Session Layer (5)
  - TCP/IP stack: Between application (4) and transport layer (3)
- It acts as a proxy server using address translation
  - Maps all of internal IP addresses to one "safe" IP address for incoming packet
  - Address is associated with the firewall from which all outgoing packets originate
  - Provides security as untrusted network is only aware of single IP address

### Application level firewalls

- Also known as **proxy firewall**, **application firewall** or **gateway firewall**.
- Installed on a proxy server to act as a barrier between internal and external networks.
- Implemented on the application layer.
- üìù Designed to filter traffic only for the protocols for which they are configured.
- Exposes single address instead of exposing internal network.
  - Clients first establish a connection with a proxy firewall, and then a new network connection is initiated on the client's behalf.
  - Utilizes NAT (Network address translation) to make the translations
- Can function in two modes:
  - **Active application-level firewalls**: Actively reject or deny requests
  - **Passive application-level firewalls**: More like IDS, does not filter

#### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- Type of an application firewall that filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web service.
- üìù It can prevent attacks exploiting a web application's known vulnerabilities
  - E.g. [injection](./../13-web-applications/owasp-top-10-threats.md#injection), [cross-site scripting (XSS)](./../13-web-applications/owasp-top-10-threats.md#cross-site-scripting-xss), file inclusion, and improper system configuration.

#### Application level vs Network level Firewalls

| Capability |¬†Application level |¬†Network level |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
|¬†**Configuration** | Advanced | Narrow (IPS and ports) |
|¬†**Coverage** |¬†Small (protocol-specific) | Wider (any IP-based) |
| **Speed** |¬†Slower |¬†Faster |
|¬†**Application threats** |¬†Greater security |¬†Blind |

- üí° Use multiple layers of defense in depth
  - Level 3 firewall at the edge that only allows inbound traffic on the specific ports used by apps
  - Route those ports to an L7 firewall for deeper inspection.

### Stateful multilayer inspection firewall

- Combination of different firewalls:
  - [packet filtering](#packet-filtering-firewalls) *(network layer)*: to filter packets
  - [circuit level](#circuit-level-gateway-firewalls) *(session layer)*: to verify legitimate sessions
  - [application level](#application-level-firewalls) *(application layer)*: to evaluate packets
- A type of **hybrid firewall** as it's a mix of some of the firewalls already

### Network Address Translation (NAT)

- Implemented by many firewalls just like routers
- Enables LAN to use different sets of IP addresses for external and internal traffic.
- NAT modifies the packet's IP header and translates one address space into another
- NAT allows to hide the layout of the internal network.
- **Basic NAT**
  - One-to-one mapping where each internal IP is mapped to a unique public IP.
  - Too expensive to implement
- **Port address translation (PAT)**
  - Also known as ***network address and port translation (NAPT)***, ***IP masquerading***, ***NAT overload*** and ***many-to-one NAT***.
  - Allows multiple internal IP addresses to be mapped to single public IP
  - Uses different port (and other items) for each web conversation.
  - Typically used as is the cheaper option.
- Dynamic vs Static NAT
  - **Static NAT**: one-to-one internal to public static IP address mapping
  - **Dynamic NAT**: uses a group of available public IP addresses.

### Virtual Private Network (VPN)

- A network which enables a secure connection to a private network through the Internet.
- Information is protected by encryption and integrity checks.
- Can use e.g. [IPSec](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ipsec) or [OpenVPN](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#openvpn) tunnelling protocol.
# Honeypots

- Designed as a trap for attackers who try to access the network.
- Any interaction with a honeypot points to a malicious activity.
- E.g. free proxy servers, VPNs, WiFis...
- Can be used by law enforcements to e.g. get IP of attackers, or malicious people to blackmail you.
- IDP (intrusion detection prevention) systems or admins can redirect intruders to a virtual machine as honeypot.

## Honeypot types

- **Low-interaction honeypots**
  - Mimic small number of applications and services that run on a system or network.
  - Capture information about network probes and worms.
- **Medium-interaction honeypots**
  - Mimic real operating system, applications and services
  - Capture more data compared to low-interaction honeypots
- **High-interaction honeypots**
  - Run real operating systems and applications
  - Gather information about the techniques and tools used in the attack.
- **Production honeypots**
  - Mimic the organizations real production network allowing more attacks
  - Helps network admins to take preventive measures to reduce the probability of an attack
  - Differs from high-interaction honeypots as they do not run real operating systems or applications.
- **Research honeypots**
  - High-interaction honeypots
  - Mainly used by security analysis and researchers
  - Goal is to understand how the attack was performed

## Evading honeypots

- Goal is to avoid being trapped in a honeypot
- Tools are used to detect honeypots that are installed on the network.
- Well configured honeypot is nearly impossible to detect.
- Best to target specific IPs known ahead of time to be valid machines.
- Some giveaways (see [discussions](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/90642/is-it-possible-to-detect-a-honeypot), [paper](https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&httpsredir=1&article=1027&context=adf)):
  - They can be to good too obviously insecure e.g. sitting near DMZ.
  - No network traffic
  - Unrealistic configurations e.g. IIS server on Linux, file names, drivers (e.g. VMWare defaults) etc.
  - Attacker can detect if it's running in a VM, disrupt the VM.
  - Performance degradation or fails under a sustained attack because of e.g. insufficient bandwidth.
  - Logging instructions affects total execution time of hacker commands.
- There are some attempts to automate such as [Honeypot Hunter](https://send-safe-honeypot-hunter.apponic.com/) (commercial scanner) or using [machine learning](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/scn/2019/2627608/).

## Setting up a proxy server as honeypot

- ü§ó This walkthrough is out of scope to to get better understanding, unrelated to exam.
- Setup the honeypot
  - Install [`squid`](http://www.squid-cache.org/) the proxy server: `yum install squid`
  - Start `squid`: `systemctl start quid`
  - Start automatically on reboot (good for cloud machines): `systemctl enable quid`
  - Configure in `vim /etc/squid/squid.conf`:
    - Has ACL (access list) rules to e.g. allow source ip ranges and ports for access
  - People can now use the proxy server with its public ip and port `3128` as default.
  - It will be detected by automated crawlers on internet that's looking for e.g. vulnerabilities.
- Monitor the traffic using sniffing tools such as [`tcpdump`](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-tools.md#tcpdump) or [Wireshark](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-tools.md#wireshark)
  - Create a named pipe (aka FIFO) file: `mkfifo myPipe.fifo`
  - Redirect proxy server logs to a local file
    `ssh root@<proxy-server-ip> "tcpdump -s 0 -U -n -w - -i eth0 not port 22" > myPipe.fifo`
    - `-s 0`: sets snapshots length to default `262144` bytes to take
    - `-U`: unbuffered, dump anything
    - `-n`: don't convert addresses to names
    - `-w`: write file instead of parsing and printing them out.
      - `-`: means standard output, so it writes to standard output.
    - `-i eth0`: capture traffic on `eth0` interface
    - `not port 22`: filter out own connection to the server
  - Run `wireshark-gtk -k -i myPipe.fifo` to start wireshark
- You can now use proxy using e.g. Firefox and see the traffic.
# Intrusion detection system (IDS) overview

- Detects intrusions in real time and alerts
- Can filter the traffic and alert the security personnel
  - Also known as ***intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS)*** or ***intrusion prevention systems (IPS)***
- Inspects both incoming (inbound) and outgoing (outbound) traffic
- Can be a software or hardware
- Usually placed near the firewall
  - Inside or outside depending on which traffic is being monitoring
  - üí° Good to deploy on both places (before and after DMZ) for layered defense

## Intrusion types

- **Filesystem intrusion**
  - Unexpected creation/deletion/modification of files or file attributes (e.g. permissions)
- **Network intrusion**
  - Increase in bandwidth consumption
  - Unexpected incoming connections e.g. attempted logins
  - Sudden increase of logs can be caused by DoS/DDoS
- **System intrusion**
  - Missing/modified for log, system or configuration files
  - Degradation in system performance
  - Unfamiliar processes, system reboots, crashes

## IDS types

### Network-based vs Host-based IDS

- Comparison

  | | [NIDS](#network-based-intrusion-detection-systems-nidss) |¬†[HIDS](#host-based-intrusion-detection-systems-hidss) |
  |-|----|----|
  |¬†Strength |¬†Sensing attacks from outside | Sensing attacks from inside that NIDS cannot examine |
  | Packet headers |¬†Examines |¬†Does not understand |

#### Network-based intrusion detection systems (NIDSs)

- Also known as ***network-based IDS***
- Inspects each incoming packet for anomalies and suspicious patterns.
- Can detect DoS attacks, port scans, or break-in attempts.

##### Network tap

- Typically a hardware device, which provides a way to access the data flowing across a computer network.
- Provide IDS visibility into the traffic flowing over the network
- E.g. a hub connected on the segment or a network appliance created specifically for the task

##### Snort

- [Open-source](https://www.snort.org) NIDS that's most widely deployed
- Rule-based IPS to detect and stop packages
- Can block expressions such as
  - `ÔÇß /(\%27)|(\')|(\-\-)|(\%23)|(#)/ix`
  - `/((\%27)|(\'))union/ix`

###### Snort configurations

- Alerts are defined in Snort configuration file
  - Configuration file is at `/etc/snort`, or `C:\Snort\etc`
- Can be configured to use as:
  - packet sniffer
    - E.g. `snort -vde`
  - packet logger
    - E.g. `./snort -dev -l ./log`
  - Network intrusion detection system by
    - Does not drop packets
    - Evaluates packets to check all alert rules, logging the matches.
    - E.g. `./snort -dev -l ./log -h 192.168.1.0/24 -c snort.conf`
  - Network intrusion protection System

###### Snort rules

- All rules are checked for each packet
- If multiple matches are found:
  - Alerts the most unique (specific) rule ignoring the more generic one.
- üìù **Syntax**
  - Action protocol address port -> address port (option:value;option:value)
  - E.g. `alert tcp 10.0.0.1 25 -> 10.0.0.2 25 (msg:"Sample Alert"; sid:1000;)`

#### Host-Based intrusion detection systems (HIDSs)

- Also known as ***host-based IDS***
- üìù Analyzes behavior and events on a particular host e.g. a desktop PC or a server.
- Can detect both anomalies and unauthorized changes in the filesystem.
- Log file monitoring (LFM): Monitoring logs files for malicious events.
- **File integrity checking**
  - Checking for modified files e.g. [ossec-hids](https://github.com/ossec/ossec-hids)
  - Compares the current hash value of the file against its known-good hash value.
- E.g. [Windows Defender](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/comprehensive-security), [Norton Internet Security](https://us.norton.com/internet-security)..

### Active vs passive IDS

#### Active IDS

- Also known as **Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)** or **Intrusion Protection Systems (IPS)**
- Configured to automatically block suspected attacks without any intervention required by an operator

#### Passive IDS

- Configured to only monitor and analyze network traffic activity and alert
- Does not perform any protective or corrective functions on its own

### Signature-based vs Anomaly-based IDS

- üí° Recent systems uses both (hybrid approach) to cover each others flaws

#### Signature recognition

- Also known as ***misuse detection***, ***signature based IDS*** or ***signature-based IDS***
- üìù Compares incoming and outgoing traffic to the signatures of already known attacks
- Based on a database of previous attack signatures and known system vulnerabilities.
- A signature is a recorded evidence of an intrusion or attack
- üìù **Pros**
  - Little false positives
  - No need for a training phase, starts working out of the box
- üìù **Cons**
  - Vulnerable to unique attacks, easy to fool
  - High dependency of latest updates, constant maintenance
  - Signature data consumes traffic

#### Anomaly detection

- Also known as ***not-use detection***, ***behavior based IDS*** or ***behavior-based IDS***.
- üìù Analyzes characteristics of the system's users and components and looks for deviations.
- Learns pattern of normal system activity to identify active intrusion attempts.
- Deviations from this baseline or pattern cause an alarm to be triggered.
- Can use artificial intelligence or can be based on heuristics or rules
- üìù **Pros**
  - More suitable for blocking future unknown attacks
  - Low dependency of latest updates, constant maintenance
- üìù **Cons**
  - Higher false positive alarm rates
  - Challenging to construct a model thoroughly on a regular network.

##### Protocol anomaly detection

- Identifies anomalies specific to a protocol
- Uses a model of the different ways vendors deploy the TCP/IP protocol.

## IDS alerts

- üìù **IDS alert types**
  - **True positive**: Attack + Alert
  - **False positive**: No attack + Alert
  - **True negative**: No attack + No alert
  - **False negative**: Attack + No alert
  - üí° False negatives are considered far worse than false positives
- üìù **IDS alert thresholding**
  - Also known as ***alert throttling*** or ***event filtering***.
  - Reducing the volume of repeated alerts
  - E.g. ignore alerts after nth times during X minutes

## Firewall vs IPS vs IDS

| | [Firewall](./firewall-overview.md) | IPS | IDS |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| **Abbreviation for** | - | Intrusion Prevention System | Intrusion Detection System |
|¬†**Firewall** | Filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined rules | Inspects traffic, detects it, classifies and then proactively stops malicious traffic from attack. | Monitors a traffic for malicious activity or policy violations and sends alert on detection. |
| **Working principle** | Filters traffic based on IP address and port numbers (layer 3), state of the connection (layer 4), or contents of packet (layer 7) | Inspects real time traffic and looks for traffic patterns or signatures of attack and then prevents the attacks on detection | Detects real time traffic and looks for traffic patterns or signatures of attack and them generates alerts |
| **Configuration mode** | Layer 2 to 7 | Layer 3 and 4 |  Layer 2 to 7 |
| **Usual placement** | First line of defense | After firewall | After firewall |
| **Action on unauthorized traffic detection** | Block the traffic | Block the traffic |  Alerts/alarms |
