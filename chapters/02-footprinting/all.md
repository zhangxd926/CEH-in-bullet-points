# Email footprinting

- By monitoring the email delivery and inspecting the e-mail headers
- Information includes
  - IP address of the recipient
  - Geolocation of the recipient
  - Delivery information
  - Visited links
  - Browser and OS information
  - Reading time
- Can track emails using various **email tracking tools**
  - E.g. notifies sender of the email being delivered and opened by the recipient
  - Used by marketers, sellers etc.

## Email header analysis

- Helps to determine an e-mail contains something malicious or not
- Email-headers include
  - Sender's name
  - IP/Email address of the sender
  - Mail server
  - Mail server authentication system
  - Send and delivery stamps
  - Unique number of the message

### Authentication protocol headers

- Allows you to detect forged sender addresses.
- The goal is for sender to identify itself to the receiver.
- E-mail headers include information about their pass status

#### SPF: Sender Policy Framework

- E.g. `'PASS' with IP 209.85.220.69` or `'NEUTRAL' ...`
- Verifies if the domain of the e-mail owned by the sending server.
  - If not passed, many e-mail providers just block it.
- Based on e-mail servers who publish records and says "here's the IP addresses we'll send e-mails"

#### DKIM: DomainKeys Identified Mail

- E.g. `'PASS' with domain accounts.google.com`
- Allows the receiver to verify that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was authorized by the owner of that domain using a digital signature on the domain.

#### DMARC: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance

- E.g. `PASS` or `FAIL`
- Combination of two protocols SPF + DKIM
- It builds on them and adds more policy

## Verifying email legitimacy

- Double check `FROM`
- Check the spelling in domain name so it's coming from the domain of the company
  - If it's random e-mail check if it's from one of the biggest domain providers or if something legit.
- Check IP of the domain
  - It can be someones computer (home router IP) or a private server
  - Major mail service providers checks to determine if domain of the e-mail is tied to the source IP of the e-mail (e.g. have a record)
    - ü§ó You can tie a public WiFi (e.g. coffee shop) IP to domain and send the e-mails from there.

## E-mail policies

- Different e-mail service provider have different policies regarding to their SMTP
- üí° Once hacker recognizes e-mail servers then then he/she can create accounts there, send e-mails back and further to figure out what the rules are.
- E.g. google does not allow you to see the IP address of the sender
  - They proxy it behind one of their servers
  - Workarounds are not so efficient.
- Each have own ruling list
  - Determines e.g. what kind of files that can be send

## Getting an IP address from an e-mail

- You can then get IP and a lot from browser headers including
  - browser information, OS info, device types
  - Revealing your IP is not safe as even home routers have pretty static IP addresses
    - Last usually 30 days up to 3 months
    - üí° You can still release DHCP lease in your home router settings to get a new IP from the ISP.
- You can send an image from a back-end server that you own
  - Some e-mail providers request it and hide users IP
- You can send a direct link
  - No e-mail provider can protect you from that
  - ü§ó Can be done through social engineering e.g.
    - You know from social media that Bob was celebrating yesterday. You send an e-mail stating "Hi Bob, crew and I had a great time last night, you're never going to guess what Sam did in toilet, threw himself up, check out his pictures"
  - E.g.
    1. Install apache `yum install httpd`
    2. Start apache `systemctl start httpd`
    3. Create a file: `cd /var/www/html/` then `touch <RESOURCE_NAME>;`
    4. Check logs live: `tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log`
    5. You'll get the IP address when the link (`<IP_ADDRESS>/<RESOURCE_NAME>`) is opened
       - You can find out self IP address using `curl ifconfig.me`
    6. And you can look at the location of IP using `geoiplookup <IP_ADDRESS>;`
# Footprinting overview

- Also known as **fingerprinting** or **reconnaissance**
- üìù Gathering information about a target system
- E.g. software, network protocols, operating systems or hardware devices.
- End goal is to find a way to break into the system.
- ü§ó Often offered as separate service bought by companies to check against leaks and to see what data is there.
- See also ‚Ä¢ [Reconnaissance |¬†Hacking stages](./../01-introduction/hacking-stages.md#1-reconnaissance) and ‚Ä¢¬†[Information Gathering¬†| Penetration testing phases](./../01-introduction/penetration-testing-phases.md#information-gathering)

## Footprinting types

### Passive footprinting

- Also known as **passive reconnaissance**, **passive fingerprinting** or **passive information gathering**
- üìù No direct contact with target
- Rely on information that is publicly available.
- Most difficult to detect
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ News ‚Ä¢ job postings ‚Ä¢ [WHOIS](./whois-geoiplocation-and-dns-interrogation.md#whois) databases ‚Ä¢ government records ‚Ä¢ document sifting ‚Ä¢ [dumpster diving |¬†Social engineering](./../10-social-engineering/social-engineering-types.md#dumpster-diving) ‚Ä¢ [competitive analysis](#competitive-intelligence) ‚Ä¢ browser search ‚Ä¢ map lookup ‚Ä¢ DNS lookup ‚Ä¢ Facebook/Twitter search

#### Open-source intelligence (OSINT)

- üìù Collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources
- ‚ùó "Open-source" is unrelated to open-source software or collective intelligence
- Categories: ‚Ä¢ media ‚Ä¢ internet ‚Ä¢ public government data ‚Ä¢ professional and academic publications ‚Ä¢ commercial data ‚Ä¢ grey literature
- [awesome-osint | list of tools](https://github.com/jivoi/awesome-osint), [OsintFramework | graph of tools](https://osintframework.com/)

#### Competitive intelligence

- Also known as **competitive analysis**
- Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of current and potential competitors
- Tools include
  - Traffic statistics: [Alexa](https://alexa.com)
  - News: [Google finance](https://finance.google.com)
  - Company plans/finances: ‚Ä¢ [SEC Info](https://www.secinfo.com) ‚Ä¢ [experian](https://experian.com) ‚Ä¢¬†[Market Watch](https://marketwatch.com) ‚Ä¢ [Wall Street Monitor](https://twst.com) ‚Ä¢ [EuroMonitor](https://euromonitor.com)

### Active footprinting

- Also known as **active reconnaissance**, **active fingerprinting** or **active information gathering**
- üìù Direct contact with target including
- Possible for target to be aware e.g. through tasks that may be logged or recorded
- Examples
  - Buying beers for company employees to see what you can extract.
  - Network mapping with `nmap`, perimeter mapping, port scanning, web profiling...
  - ‚Ä¢ E-mail tracking ‚Ä¢ Phishing scheme with an email ‚Ä¢ Querying name servers ‚Ä¢ File metadata ‚Ä¢ Social engineering ‚Ä¢ Extracting DNS information ‚Ä¢ [Traceroute](./network-footprinting.md#traceroute) analysis
- üí° Easier idea to start with passive footprinting by gathering all publicly available data
  - Then organizing it, and putting in one place.
  - Then use active footprinting with starting probing for ports, networks, possible vulnerabilities etc.
- üí°Good to learn more about stuff (employees) of a company
  - through them you can learn a lot more and gain a lot more access
  - e.g. contact them through social media and start a conversation
    - e.g. join a conference that you see the person is attending on LinkedIn and meet him.

## Footprinting information

- **Network information**
  - Domains, subdomains
  - IP addresses
  - [Whois](./whois-geoiplocation-and-dns-interrogation.md#whois) and DNS records
  - VPN firewalls using e.g. [ike-scan](https://github.com/royhills/ike-scan)
- **System information**
  - Web server operating systems
  - Server locations
  - Users
  - Passwords
- **Organization information**
  - Employee information
  - Organization's background
  - Phone numbers

## Footprinting objectives

- **Learn security posture**
  - Analyze security
  - Find loopholes
  - Create an attack plan
- **Identify focus area**
  - Narrow down the range of IP addresses.
- **Find vulnerabilities**
  - Identify weaknesses in the target's security.
- **Map the network**
  - Graphical representation of target's network a guide during the attack.

## Footprinting tools

- Collects and visualizes information e.g. ‚Ä¢ IP location ‚Ä¢ routing ‚Ä¢ business ‚Ä¢ address ‚Ä¢ phone number ‚Ä¢ social security number ‚Ä¢ source of an email and a file ‚Ä¢ DNS ‚Ä¢ domain
- üìù **[Maltego](https://www.maltego.com/)**
  - Proprietary software for open-source intelligence (OSINT)
  - Provides graphical link for investigative tasks.
- **[Recon-ng (The Recon-ng Framework)](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng)**
  - Open source CLI tools for open source web-based reconnaissance
- **[FOCA](https://github.com/ElevenPaths/FOCA)**
  - Fingerprinting Organizations with Collected Archives
  - Open-source tool to find metadata and hidden information in the documents:
    1. Finds documents (e.g. PDF, SVG) through search engines or manual upload
    2. Analyze them and identify which documents are created by same team, using which servers/clients.
- **[Recon-dog](https://github.com/s0md3v/ReconDog)**
  - Open-source CLI tool self-claimed as Reconnaissance Swiss Army Knife
  - Can extracts targets from STDIN (piped input) and act upon them
  - Passive reconnaissance tool extracting all information with APIs without any contact with target
- **[Dmitry](https://github.com/jaygreig86/dmitry)** (DeepMagic Information Gathering Tool)
  - CLI tool to analyze a website e.g. `dmitry https://cloudarchitecture.io`
  - ‚Ä¢ Performs [WHOIS](./whois-geoiplocation-and-dns-interrogation.md#whois) lookup on IP and domain ‚Ä¢ Retrieves [Netcraft](./search-engines-and-online-resources.md#netcraft) information ‚Ä¢ Search for subdomains/email addresses ‚Ä¢ Performs TCP scanning ‚Ä¢ Grabs banner for each port

## Footprinting reports

- Includes
  - Details about the performed tests
  - Used techniques
  - Test results
- It should also include
  - List of vulnerabilities and how they can be fixed
    - E.g. wrong configuration in webserver because you're allowing a forward and somebody is using your proxy for reflection attacks.
      - Reflection attack = Send a packet from A to B, A gives wrong source IP for DDoS attacks.
  - List sources of information e.g. DNS, social medial, social engineering.
  - List what information you gathered from each source
    - E.g. login pages, technologies, files, contact details, GPS location, IP address, email servers.
- Should be kept highly confidential

## Countermeasures

- Enforcing security policies
- Educating employees about security threats
  - Raises awareness, reduces risks dramatically
- Encrypting sensitive information
  - üí° Use proper encryption everywhere
    - ü§ó Many companies uses VPN/proxy with encryption for outside communication, but service communicate with each other without any encryption.
- Disabling protocols that are not required
- Proper service configuration
  - Double check all services that application depends.
  - Do not disable/enable configuration without knowing consequences.
- Scrutinize information released to the public domain
  - E.g. you post on social media which routers the company has just bought
    - Allows hacker to
      - know default router configurations
      - get image of OS in the router and conduct tests in a VM
- Limit site caching
  - Inform search engines what they're supposed to index through e.g. `robots.txt`
    - E.g `User-agent: * Disallow: /` prevents indexing any page (`Disallow: /`) for any crawler (`User-agent: *`)
- Use Whois Guard
- Restricting access to social media
  - Extra risk as you click on many links and giving away companies IP address
# Network footprinting

- Collecting network range information to use the information to map the target's network
- Gives insights into how the network is structured and which machines belong to the network.

## Nmap

- Used for network discovery
- Uses raw IP packets to determine e.g.
  - the available hosts on the network
  - the services offered by those hosts
  - operating systems they are
  - firewall types that are being used
  - and more...
- Not only used for malicious purposes but also for checking something is working as intended
  - e.g. check why a port is open and confirm it's closed
- E.g. `nmap -v -p 0-2000 -O -sV 178.128.203.1`
  - `-v`: verbose, more output than usual
    - `-d` prints even more.
  - `-p`: for port
    - default: 0-1024
    - the higher the ranges is the longer it takes.
  - `-O`: os detection (best guess)
  - `-sV`: versions of all detected services (best guess)
    - üí° Allows you to check for vulnerabilities of a specific version of that services e.g. through [exploit database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
  - `178.128.203.1`: can also specify subnet also e.g. `/24`
- ü§ó In UK and Germany it's illegal to conduct a scan on a network, more [Nmap | legal issues](https://Nmap.org/book/legal-issues.html)
- Read more about Nmap in [Nmap | Scanning Tools](./../03-scanning-networks/scanning-tools.md#nmap)

## Traceroute

- üìù Programs used for discovering routers that are on the path to the target host.
- You always go through multiple hops before you reach target
  - E.g. first hop being your router, then routers & switches ISP provider and the router that sends traffic out of the country...
- Helps hacker to collect information about
  - network topology
  - trusted routers
  - firewall locations
- Can use protocols such as `ICMP` (often), `TCP`, `UDP`, `DCPP`..
- ‚ùó There can be hops that are invisible/undetectable
  - üí° You can craft special packets to detect them with custom time to lives, their failure
- Uses TTL field in the IP header to discover the route.
  - Starts by setting TTL to 1
  - Stops at each hop on the way to the destination and providing information to the sender about that hop
  - The TTL is incremented by 1 for each hop discovered
- Used to create network diagrams and plan attacks.
- Helps with e.g. man-in-the-middle attacks.
- It records IP addresses and DNS names of discovered routers.
- Commands
  - Unix tool: `traceroute 178.128.203.1` (uses UDP)
  - Using Nmap: `nmap traceroute --script traceroute-geolocation 178.128.203.1 -d`
  - Using hping: `hping3 ‚Äìtraceroute -S {target ip}`
  - Windows tool: `tracert 178.128.203.1` (uses ICMP)
# Search engines and online resources

- For e.g. information about the target organization's employees, intranet, login pages...
- Sources include ‚Ä¢ social networking sites ‚Ä¢ people search services ‚Ä¢ alerting services ‚Ä¢ financial services ‚Ä¢ job sites showing target infrastructure details, physical location, and employee details ‚Ä¢ deep and dark web

## Google hacking

- Involves using a set of search operators (**dorks**) and building complex queries.
- üìù Form of [passive reconnaissance](./footprinting-overview.md#passive-footprinting)
- Common dorks:

  | Dork | Definition | Example |
  | ---- | ---------- | ------- |
  | **`site`** | Only from the specified domain | `azure site:cloudarchitecture.io` |
  | **`inurl`** | Only pages that has the query in its URL. | `inurl: cloudarchitecture` |
  | **`intitle`** | Only pages that has the query in its title. | `intitle: cloud architecture` |
  | **`cache`** | Cached versions of the queried page | `cache:cloudarchitecture.io` |
  | **`link`** | Only pages that contain the queried URL. Discontinued. | `link:cloudarchitecture.io` |
  | **`filetype`** | Only results for the given filetype | `filetype:sql` |

- üìù Usual to combine `filetype` and `site` dorks as see in [metagoofil](#metagoofil)
- Google logical query operators

  | Operator | Definition | Example |
  | ---- | ---------- | ------- |
  | **`OR`**, **`|`** | X or Y but not both | `jobs OR gates`, `jobs | gates` |
  | **`AND`** | Results related to both X and Y, google default. | `jobs AND gates` |
  | **`-`** | Exclude a term or phrase | `jobs ‚Äëapple` |
  | **`*`** | Wildcard that will match any word or phrase. | `"Google * my life"` > google changed my life, google runs my life... |
  | **`(`**, **`)`** | Group multiple terms | `(iPad OR iPhone) apple` |

- E.g. finding passwords: `intext:"please change your" password | code | login file:pdf | doc | txt | docx -github`
  - **`intext`**: in the text of the website
  - **`"please change your" password"`**: Placing something in quote marks  means it must contain the text as whole, not parts of it.
  - **`file:pdf`**: specify what kind of file you want.
  - **`-github`**: minus + word tells to exclude results containing that word(s).
- For complex searches use:
  - [Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) (no need for dorks)
  - [Google Advanced Image Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search)
- üí° Easier way may be using [Google Advanced Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_search) or [Advanced Image Search](https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search)

### Google hacking tools

- [**Google hack honeypot**](http://ghh.sourceforge.net)
  - Logs google hacking queries against your resources
- [**Google hacking database**](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)
  - Helps you with
    - finding various types of files, including those that contain usernames and passwords.
    - VoIP footprinting using e.g. `intitle:"D-Link VoIP Router" "Welcome"` to find pages containing D-Link login portals
    - VPN footprinting using e.g. `filetype:pcf "cisco" "GroupPwd"` to find Cisco VPN files with passwords
  - üí° Once you find password lists and you can guess similar ones as people usually have similar passwords.

#### metagoofil

- [Open-source](https://github.com/laramies/metagoofil) tool to extract metadata of public documents (pdf,doc,xls,ppt,etc) available in the target websites
- Also helps with [website footprinting](./website-footprinting.md)
- Flow
  1. Queries Google for different filetypes that may have metadata
     - Combining `site:` and `filetype` dorks
  2. Downloads the documents to disk and extracts the metadata of the file
  3. Parses files using different libraries for metadata (e.g. Hachoir, pdfminer)

## Online services

- Searching domain gives you some data about e.g. IP address, server, geolocation.
  - ‚ùóCareful, can be fairly inaccurate, Generic results = No guarantee.
    - Far better to do your own search
    - Generic results = No guarantee
- [Website Watcher](https://www.aignes.com/) to get notified if a web page is changed.

### Reverse image search

- Allows tracking original source of an image
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ Google Image Search ‚Ä¢ TinEye Reverse Image Search ‚Ä¢ Yahoo Image Search

### Video search engines

- Search video related to target and extract video information
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ YouTube ‚Ä¢ Google Videos
- Video analysis tools include ‚Ä¢ YouTube DataViewer ‚Ä¢ EZGif ‚Ä¢ VideoReverser.com,

### Meta data engines

- Uses other search engines to build meta data of Internet
- Can give more information such as images, videos, blogs, news, articles about target
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ Startpage ‚Ä¢ MetaGer

### FTP search engines

- Search files on FTP servers
- E.g. ‚Ä¢ NAPALM FTP Indexer ‚Ä¢ Global FTP Search Engine
- Can help to find tax documents, business strategies etc.

### IoT search engines

- Can allow finding e.g. manufacturer details, geographical location, IP address, hostname, open ports
- E.g. [Shodan](#shodan), Censys, and Thingful
- See [Information Gathering | IoT security](./../18-iot-and-ot/iot-security.md#information-gathering)

#### Shodan

- Online [search engine](https://shodan.io)
- Finds specific types of IoT (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet using a variety of filters.
- üìù You can e.g. search for open ports `port: 1433`

#### Censys

- Online [censys](https://censys.io/)
- üìù Provides internet asset discovery i.e. scanning for unknown internet resources.
- Available on [search.censys.io](https://search.censys.io/)

### Netcraft

- Allows you search web by domain (DNS) through [search DNS](https://searchdns.netcraft.com/) service.
- Reports more information such as
  - If it uses HTML5 or flash (flash has many vulnerabilities)
  - `X-Frame-Options`: Do not allow this site to be rendered in an iframe
    - If it's allowed it allows for a phishing scheme such as [clickjacking](./../13-web-applications/hacking-web-applications.md#clickjacking)

### [CrimeFlare](http://www.crimeflare.org:82/cfs.html)

- Helps you find IP addresses behind a CDN (e.g. CloudFlare)
- **CDN**: Protects against DDoS, geolocation of servers by having different IP address.
- People often use real IP addresses before CDN, you can then look at past DNS records to find it.
# Website footprinting

- Hackers can map the entire website of the target without being noticed
- Gives information about:
  - Software
  - Operating system
  - Subdirectories
  - Contact information
  - Scripting platform
  - Query details

## Web spiders

- Programs designed to help in website footprinting
- Methodically browse a website in search of specific information.
- Information collected this way can help attackers perform social engineering attacks.

## Cookie examination

- Reveals what software that is running on the server and its behavior
- Possible to identify the scripting platforms.

## Examining website headers

- By examining the website headers, it is possible to obtain information about:
  - `Content-Type`
  - `Accept-Ranges`
  - Connection Status
  - `Last-Modified` Information
  - `X-Powered-By` Information
    - E.g. `ZendServer 8.5.0,ASP.NET`
  - Web Server Information
    - `Server` header can give you e.g. `Apache Server on CentOS`
- You can also analyze what website pulls
  - In debugging developer tool of most browsers (ctrl+shift+c) network section
  - For each request you can see remote IP address, and response headers for further analysis.

## Source code examination

### Comment analysis

- Possible to extract information from the comments
- In most of browsers you can right click and how source
- Walkthrough
  - In almost any browser: Right click => Show source
  - Check for HTML `<!-- comment -->` or JavaScript `// comment` comments
  - They are skipped by interpreters and compilers, only for human eyes
  - They can be instructions for other developers, notes for themselves
    - E.g. this library won't work as this element is not supported
      - Gives you clues about what technology (frameworks, languages) they use in the background

### Observing link and image tags

- Html links: `href=cloudarchitecture.io`
- Gain insight into the file system structure
- You can find e.g. a caching server and check vulnerabilities for that caching server.

## Cloning websites

- Also called **website mirroring**
- Helps in
  - browsing the site offline
  - searching the website for vulnerabilities
  - discovering valuable information and metadata.
- Can be protected with some detections based on e.g. page pull speed, behavior, known scrapers, AI.
- üí° Good tool for setting up fake websites.
  - E.g. manually recreate login pages
  - If you control the DNS you can do a redirect.
- Allows you to save social media pages with this however most are protected, and illegal to clone.
- **Website monitoring tools** can send notifications on detected changes.
- üí° Protection against fake websites
  - Always check domain name for misspelling
  - Make sure it's HTTP**S**, if it's not the data can be sniffed easily
    - Protects against someone taking over DNS
    - If the other part does not have the certificate, browser does not accept communication
  - Check SSL certificate authority, if it's changing, it can prompt a question.
    - Certificates expire usually in a year.

### Website cloning tools

- [`httrack`](https://github.com/xroche/httrack)
  - `httrack https://testwebpage.com` to copy
- üìù `wget`
  - Basic utility that can be used for mirroring website
- Or one could manually copy paste source code of HTML + CSS

## Extracting metadata

- You can extract metadata of files (e.g. images) from a webpage
- Metadata can include
  - Owner of the file
  - GPS coordinates (images)
  - File type metadata
    - ü§ó Linux does not work with extensions e.g. `.pdf` but checks for the metadata.
    - Helpful as you will not be fooled by the extension

### Tools for extracting metadata

- **`hexdump`**
  - Dump file as ASCII and inspect manually
  - E.g. `hexdump -C TEST_DOCUMENT.docx`
  - ‚ùó Not recommended as it's pretty hard to extract information from binary.
- **[`ExifTool`](https://exiftool.org/)**
  - Reads + writes metadata of audio, video, PDF, docs etc.
  - E.g. `exiftool TEST_DOCUMENT.docx` would return something like `Microsoft Office Word`, `Version: 16.0`
- üìù **[Metagoofil |¬†Google hacking tool](./search-engines-and-online-resources.md#google-hacking-tools)**
  - Search for files that may have metadata for a website using Google and dump their metadata.
# WHOIS, GeoIpLocation and DNS interrogation

- All public records, accessing is not illegal.

## WHOIS

- Query and response protocol (port 43)
- Used for retrieving information about assigned Internet resources
- To get WHOIS information you can
  - Use different websites such as [whois.net](https://www.whois.net)
  - Use command-line: `whois cloudarchitecture.io`
- Two models
  - **Thick WHOIS**: information from all registrars for the specified set of data.
  - **Thin WHOIS**: limited information about the specified set of data.

### WHOIS results

- Domain details
- üìù Domain owner details
  - Includes contact information of the owner
  - Can be hidden by a **WHOIS guard**
    - A proxy between the owner of the domain and who's accessing
    - Emails are usually still redirected to the owner.
      - üí° Allows for e-mail phishing to learn who the actual owner is.
- Domain server
  - Who it's registered with e.g. [NameCheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com), [Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net)
  - üí° Site owner might have account in the server, and you can test passwords there.
- Net range
- Domain expiration
  - üí° If auto-renewal fails, someone can transfer a domain to another address for malicious behaviors or just to sell it back to you.
- Creation and last update dates

### Regional internet registries

- WHOIS databases are maintained by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) such as:
  - **ARIN**: American Registry for Internet Numbers
  - **AFRINIC**: African Network Information Center
  - **APNIC**: Asia Pacific Network Information Center
  - **RIPE**: R√©seaux IP Europ√©ens Network Coordination Centre
  - **LACNIC**: Latin American and Caribbean Network Information Center
- ü§ó Every ISP, hosting company etc. must be member of one of the registries to get IP addresses.

## IP geolocation

- Helps find location information about a target
- Includes country, city, postal code, ISP, and so on
  - Country is mostly accurate but city, coordinates are not but approximated
- Helps with social engineering attacks
- E.g. [GeoIpTool.com](https://geoiptool.com)

### DNS interrogation

- Collecting information about DNS zone data.
  - e.g. server types and their locations
- Includes information about key hosts in the network
- üìù E.g. `host -t a cloudarchitecture.com`
  - `t` stands for type of domain record `a` gives A type of domain records.
  - Returns something likes this:

    ```txt
        cloudarchitecture.io has address 13.33.17.159
        cloudarchitecture.io has address 13.33.17.136
    ```

  - A records returns multiple IP addresses to increase speed and availability e.g. when hosting same content in multiple continents.
- See also [DNS enumeration](./../04-enumeration/dns-enumeration.md#dns-records)

#### Reverse DNS lookup

- Use one of IP addresses that's listed as an A
