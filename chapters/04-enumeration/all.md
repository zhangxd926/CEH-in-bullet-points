# DNS enumeration

## DNS

- Stands for "Domain Name System"
- Hierarchical and decentralized naming system
- Used for resources connected to the Internet including computers and services
- Runs on TCP/UDP port 53

### DNS records

- Database record used to map a URL to an IP address
- Stored in zone files in DNS servers
  - A DNS server contains a "zone file" for each domain
  - Zone file is made up of "resource records" (RRs)
- Helps users connect their websites to the outside world.
- üìù Common DNS records include
  - **`A`**
    - Points a domain to an IPv4 address, such as `11.22.33.44`.
  - **`AAAA`**
    - Points a domain to an IPv6 address, such as `FE80::0202:B3FF:FE1E:8329`.
  - **`MX`**
    - Mail eXchange records are used to direct emails sent to domain
    - See also [MX records | Whois, GeoIpLocation and DNS interrogation](./../02-footprinting/whois-geoiplocation-and-dns-interrogation.md#mx-records)
  - **`NS`**
    - Used to delegate a domain or subdomain to a set of name servers
  - **`SOA`**
    - Contains data to control the zone transfer.
    - Includes serial number, timestamps, mail address of zone responsible..
    - E.g.

      ```txt

        $TTL 86400
        @   IN  SOA     ns.icann.org. noc.dns.icann.org. (
                2020080302  ;Serial
                7200        ;Refresh
                3600        ;Retry
                1209600     ;Expire
                3600        ;Minimum TTL
        )

      ```

  - **`CNAME`**
    - Link a subdomain to a domain's existing A or AAAA record
    - E.g. `www.cloudarchitecture.io` to `cloudarchitecture.io`
  - **`PTR`**
    - Opposite of `A`, points an IP to domain
    - Commonly used for spam verification for e-mail programs
  - **`HINFO`**
    - System information including CPU and OS type.

## DNS enumeration techniques

- Check all NS Records for [zone transfers](#zone-transfers).
- Enumerate general [DNS records](#dns-records) for a given domain.
- Perform common SRV Record Enumeration.
  - Service records contain the hostname, port and priority of servers for a given service.
  - Enumerates e.g. ‚Ä¢ LDAP ‚Ä¢ Autodiscover for Exchange ‚Ä¢ Kerberos...
  - E.g. by `nmap --script dns-srv-enum --script-args "dns-srv-enum.domain='google.com'"`
- Brute force subdomain and host A and AAAA records discovery with given top domain and wordlist.
- DNS PTR lookup given a IP range CIDR range
  - Querying dns for PTR record of each IP in subnet
- See also [DNS interrogation](./../02-footprinting/whois-geoiplocation-and-dns-interrogation.md#dns-interrogation)

### DNS cache snooping

- Checks a DNS server cached records.
   Done by performing **non-recursive** (or also known as **iterative**) DNS queries
  - Also known as iterative query
  - Server returns either its own record or another DNS server that may know the answer.
  - As opposed to [recursive DNS lookup](../12-web-servers/web-server-threats-and-attacks.md#recursive-dns-lookup) where servers communicates with other DNS servers.
- **Tools**
  - Automated: [dnsrecon](#dnsrecon)
  - üìù Manual:
    - `dig` with `+norecurse` flag
    - `nslookup` with `-norecurse` flag
    - `host` with `-r` flag

## Zone transfers

- DNS server passes a copy of part of it's database ("zone") to another DNS server
- There's one master DNS server, and one or more slave DNS servers
  - Slaves ask master for a copy of records
- Uses TCP port 53
- üìù Uses **AXFR** (full) protocol or **IXFR** (incremental).
- The secondary server request a new copy if the primary SOA serial number is higher.
  - The primary increments the serial number every time the SOA changes
  - If the secondary checks in and the primary‚Äôs copy has a higher serial number

### DNS zone transfer attack

- Pretending to be a slave and ask for records
- Allows an attacker to obtain sensitive information about internal DNS records (network).
- üìù Flow
  1. Get NS records (DNS servers that are responsible for resolving the queries)
     - Using `dig`: `dig ns zonetransfer.me` or `dig +short ns zonetransfer.me`
     - Using `nslookup`: `nslookup zonetransfer.me`
  2. Initiate AXFR request to get a copy of the zone from name server
     - Using `dig`: `dig axfr @<DNS you are querying> <target>`
       - E.g. `dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me`
     - Using `nslookup`
       - `nslookup -ls -d nsztm1.digi.ninja`
         - `-d`: list all records for DNS domain
         - Sends AXFR query to the remote nameserver
         - Initiates zone transfer if and only if the remote nameserver is dumb enough to respond to unsolicited, unauthorized AXFRs originating from random machines on the Internet.
       - Or using interactive mode with specified a DNS server:

       ```txt
         $ nslookup
         > server <DNS you are querying>
         > set type=any
         > ls -d <target>
       ```

     - Or `nslookup -query=AXFR <target> <DNS you are querying>`
     - Using `host`: `host -l nsztm1.digi.ninja`
- ü§ó In June 2017 the registrar responsible for Russian top-level-domains accidentally enabled DNS zone transfers via AXFR which led to 5.6 million records being accidentally exposed | [source](https://securitytrails.com/blog/russian-tlds)

### Zone transfers countermeasures

- Do not allow or restrict zone transfers
- Use [split DNS](#split-dns)

#### Split DNS

- Also known as ***split-horizon DNS***, ***split-view DNS***, ***split-brain DNS*** or ***split DNS***
- üìù Separation of internal network (intranet) DNS and public network (Internet) DNS
- Provides different answers to DNS queries based on the source address of the DNS request.
- Can be accomplished with hardware or software solutions

## DNS enumeration tools

### dnsrecon

- [Open source](https://github.com/darkoperator/dnsrecon) python script
- E.g. `./dnsrecon.py -d cloudarchitecture.io`
- Enumerates DNS records and more

### nslookup

- Limited: Depends on existence of DNS reverse lookup zone.
- Forward lookup (normal): Here's name give me IP
- Reverse lookup: Here's IP give me back the name

### dig

- *Nix tool for querying DNS
- E.g. `dig cloudarchitecture.io any`
  - `any` argument (optional): all records it can find
- `dig axfr cloudarchitecture.io`

### `host`

- On Unix-like operating systems, the `host` command is a DNS lookup utility
- Using e.g. `host <target-domain>` to see all records.
- üìù You can also set type `-t` to see specific records e.g.
  - `host -t a <target-domain>` to see A records
  - `host -t ns <target-domain>` to see NS records
  - ...
# Enumeration overview

- Actively engage a system and query it for information.
- Used to discover vulnerabilities and then exploit them.
- Information collected include routing tables, users and groups, machine names, network resources.

## Enumeration techniques

- Extracting user names using email ID's
  - E.g. if the e-mail is tom.john@smith.com then tom.john is probably the user name
- Extract information using the default password
  - Identifying OS would tell the default password
  - If no one has changed it can be used to gather more information.
- [DNS enumeration](./dns-enumeration.md)

### Windows enumeration

- **Enumerating all shares**
  - `net share` or `net view \\serverName /all`
- **Enumerating machine configuration through null sessions**
  - Null sessions allow for enumeration of Windows machines to access information about the machine configuration.
  - E.g. `net use \\target\ipc$ "" /user: "`
- **Configurable services and server/workstation settings**
  - `net config`

### Windows user account enumeration

#### Security Identifier (SID)

- A **subject** can access an **object** with given **permissions**
- **Subject** (who)
  - Windows internally identifies entities as "Security Principals" also known as "Subject"s
  - E.g. user accounts, groups, computers and services
- Subjects are assigned SID (Security Identifier) by the system
- E.g. S-**1**-**5**-**21**-1852694824-1489621752-332472329-**500**
- üìù Format: `S-<revision-level>-<authority-id>-<first-subauthority>-<o-N subauthorities>-<relative identifier(RID)>`
  - **Authority ID**
    - 0 - `SECURITY_NULL_SID_AUTHORITY` - null group or nobody
    - 1 - `SECURITY_WORLD_SID_AUTHORITY` - account Everybody
    - 2 - `SECURITY_LOCAL_SID_AUTHORITY` - group account Local (logged in users)
    - 3 - `SECURITY_CREATOR_SID_AUTHORITY` - Creator Owner
    - 5 - `SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY` - Created by OS
    - There are [many more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/security-identifiers-in-windows)
  - **Sub Authority ID**
    - 5 - For applications that run under a specific session
    - 6 - When a process authenticates as a service
    - 21 - For SIDs that are not universal but has local significance
    - 32 - Identifies built-in SIDs
    - 80 - Identifies services' SIDs
  - **Relative identifier (RID)**
    - 500 - Administrator
    - 501 - Guest

#### Windows user account enumeration tools

- `user2sid` and `sid2touser`: Brings SID value for a given account name and vice versa
  - E.g. `user2sid \\SVR1 Guest`
  - Getting SID allows enumeration of accounts/groups by changing RID
    - E.g. `sid2user \\SVR1 5 21 1928525985 232339646 3462474693 501`
      - Returns like `Name is Guest`, `Domain is DEMO`, `Type of SID is SidTypeUser`
      - Syntax: `sid2user [\computer_name] authority subauthority_1 ‚Ä¶`
- [`dumpusers`](https://vidstromlabs.com/freetools/dumpusers/): All-in-one tool to dump account names and information
- [`GetAcct`](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/download/25056/getacct003.zip): Can dump account information as CSV file.
- From [SystemTools](https://www.systemtools.com/index.html):
  - [DumpSec](https://www.systemtools.com/somarsoft/index.html): lists all users and the groups they are in
  - [Hyena](https://www.systemtools.com/hyena/download.htm?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIq9udy-mF7QIVlB4YCh1yUgPoEAAYASAAEgK8T_D_BwE) dumps shares and user login names for Windows domain controllers and servers on same network.
- [PsGetSid](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psgetsid): Translates SIDs to their display name and vice versa

### NetBIOS enumeration

- NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a unique name of a Windows machine.
- üìù Allow computers
  - to communicate with others at the same time
  - to share files and printers
- Uses SMB (service message block) protocol
  - Network file sharing protocol.
  - ü§ó Was targeted by [WannaCry ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack) who traversed the network and injected hosts.
- Easily exploitable, often used as one of the first scans.
- Helps to collect: ‚Ä¢ System name ‚Ä¢ Username ‚Ä¢¬†Domain ‚Ä¢¬†Printers ‚Ä¢ Available shares

#### NetBIOS enumeration tools

- [nbtstat](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/nbtstat)
  - Proprietary Windows diagnostic tool for NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
  - `nbtstat -a <IP or hostname>`: shows NetBIOS names
- `net view <IP or hostname>` prints available shares such as printers.
- [smb-nat](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/smb-nat.1.html)
  - NetBIOS Auditing Tool)
  - `nat -o <output file> -u <user-list> -p <password-list> <ip/range>` allows you to brute force different usernames and passwords for administrative shares.
- [WinFingerPrint](https://github.com/kkuehl/winfingerprint)
  - Windows enumeration tool
  - Scan machines in LAN and returns shares, disk information, services, users (SID), groups..

### SNMP enumeration

- Also known as ***SNMP walking***
- SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol.
- Used for
  - monitoring networking equipment
  - remotely modifying settings and configs on the equipment
- Was developed for routers and switches (1988)
  - Extended for linux/windows machines, printers, sensors, power supplies and more...
- Two kind of **community strings**:
  - Read community string: read-only.
    - You can collect information such as
      - System name, system uptime, network settings, CPU usage level etc.
  - Read/write community string: read-write (private) to edit configurations
  - üí° SNMPv3 encrypts the community strings
- Consists of a **manager** and an **agent**
  - **Agent**s are embedded into network devices.
    - Agents send their information to manager using port 162.
    - Data messages are called traps.
  - **Manager** is installed on a computer.
    - Needs two passwords to access and configure the agents:
      - read community string
      - read/write community string
- **Object identifier (OID)**
  - Any device that can be monitored has an OID.
  - E.g. `1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8`
- **Management Information Base (MIB)**
  - Text-file that translates numerical OIDs to word-based OIDs.
    - E.g. `SYNOLOGY-SYSTEM-MIB::temperature.0`
  - You can collect information CPU usage level, disk usage level, network settings using vendor-specific OIDs.
- Version 1, 2: (‚ùóÔ∏è insecure) No encryption, only "community string" and no encryption
- Version 3: Username + password and encryption

#### SNMP enumeration tools

- [**`snmpwalk`**](https://ezfive.com/snmpsoft-tools/snmp-walk/)
  - Enumerates ports in SNMP agent and finds out UDP port sending traffic to manager.
  - `snmpwalk -c public -v1 <agent IP address>`
  - Starts listening to the port.
- **`snmp-check`**
  - You can find out the version using `snmp-check <IP address> -v <version 1 or 2c>`
    - Gives much more information like routing tables, storage information, users etc.
- [**`snmp-get`**](https://ezfive.com/snmpsoft-tools/snmp-get/)
  - Retrieve specific OID information from target using `-o`
  - SNMP community string for SNMP v1/v2c.
    - E.g. `sysName.0` for system name
  - E.g. `snmpget -v 1 -c public system.sysName.0`

### LDAP enumeration

- See also [brute-forcing active directory](#brute-forcing-active-directory)

#### LDAP

- LDAP stands for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
- Used by on-premises Active Directory (Microsoft)
- üìù Hierarchical e.g. domain > child-domains > organizational units > users / groups / computers.
- May return information about usernames, addresses, servers, and other sensitive information.
  - could be utilized in a brute force or social engineering attacks.

#### LDAP enumeration countermeasures

- Use over encrypted and secure protocols e.g. by e.g.
  - **LDAP over SSL/TLS**
    - Also known as **LDAPS**
    - SSL/TLS is negotiated before LDAP protocol begins.
  - **LDAP over StartTLS**
    - STARTTLS is a way to take an existing insecure connection and upgrade it to a secure connection using TLS.
    - Communication is only encrypted after the connection is established.
- Use NTLM or Basic authentication
- Select a username different from your email address

#### LDAP enumeration tools

- [Jxplorer](https://www.jxplorer.org/)
- [LDAP Admin Tool](https://www.ldapsoft.com)
- [LDP.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771022(v=ws.11))
- [Softerra LDAP Administrator](https://www.ldapadministrator.com/)
- üìù [`net use`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/gg651155(v=ws.11)) to show list of connected resources and logged-in user accounts.

### NTP enumeration

#### NTP

- üìù NTP (Network Time Protocol) is to synchronize computer clocks.
- E.g. machines in same domain in Active Directory must have same GMT clocks.
- Uses UDP 123
- Target accuracy
  - 10 ms over the public internet
  - 200 ms or better on a local area network
- ü§ó Usually companies have authority of time-source on their on-premises, it synchronizes to internet and everything else synchronizes to it.
  - Important for routers / switches to have logs with right timestamps.
- Attackers query NTP for
  - List of hosts connected to NTP server
  - Clients IP addresses, system names and operating systems.
  - Internal IP addresses can be acquired if the NTP server is on the DMZ

#### NTP enumeration tools

- [`ntptrace`](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/html/ntptrace.html): traces NTP servers back to the primary source.
- [`ntpdc`](http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.2/ntpdc.htm): monitors operation of the NTP daemon, ntpd
- [`ntpq`](http://doc.ntp.org/4.1.0/ntpq.htm): monitors NTP daemon ntpd operations and determines performance.
- Other tools include: ‚Ä¢ NTP Time Server Monitor ‚Ä¢ NTP server Scanner ‚Ä¢ Nmap ‚Ä¢ Wireshark ‚Ä¢ AtomSync ‚Ä¢ NTPQuery, ‚Ä¢ PresenTense NTP Auditor ‚Ä¢ PresenTense Time Server¬†‚Ä¢ PresenTense Time Client ‚Ä¢ Lan Time Analyser...

### SMTP enumeration

#### SMTP

- SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (port: 25)
- Protocol used for sending/receiving e-mails.
  - Used by clients talk to SMTP servers
  - Used also by SMTP servers to talk to other servers.
- Secure/encrypted protocols include:
  - **SMTPS** is SMTP over TLS (port: 587)
    - ü§ó Like HTTPS is HTTP over TLS
  - SMTP can also run with STARTTLS (port: 467)
    - Compared to running over TLS, it encrypts communication AFTER the communication is established.
    - STARTTLS is also known as **opportunistic TLS** as it would fall back to unencrypted communication if server does not support it.
- See [MX records](./dns-enumeration.md#dns-records) to find SMTP servers
- Allows to validate e-mail addresses to ensure they exist
  - ü§ó One another: Go to provider ‚Üí try creating account with that e-mail.
  - ü§ó Large collection of e-mails can be sold or used for phishing.
  - ü§ó Many e-mail senders (e.g. AWS Simple Email Service) blocks you if you send e-mails that will not reach the targets.
    - One idea is to create fake accounts in cloud providers ‚Üí ask to increase soft limits ‚Üí enumerate per accounts

#### SMTP enumeration through SMTP commands

- `VRFY`: validates e-mail address that actually exists
- `EXPN`: tells the actual delivery address of aliases and mailing lists
- `RCPT TO`: Defines recipients of the messages
- ‚ùó Some admins may turn off `VRFY` and `EXPN`, but not `RCPT TO` (or no one can receive e-mail)

#### SMTP enumeration through tools

- [NetScanTools Pro SMTP Server Tests Tool Description](https://www.netscantools.com/nstpro_smtp_server_tests.html)
  - Used to perform tests sending e-mails
- [`smtp-user-enum`](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/smtp-user-enum)
  - Enumerates OS-level user accounts on Solaris
  - Inspects responses to `VRFY`, `EXPN` and `RCPT TO`
  - ![smtp-user-enum example](img/smtp-user-enum.png)
    - `stmpy-user-enum -M <command> -U <list of emails> -t <SMTP server>`

### Brute forcing Active Directory

1. Get admin user with [SID 500](#security-identifier-sid)
   - `Get-ADUser -Filter * | where { $_.SID -like "*-500" }`
2. Brute-force its credentials
   - E.g. if user is `admin@cloudarchitecture.io`:
     - `net use \\%computername% "PasswordTest1" /u:admin@cloudarchitecture.io`
     - `net use \\%computername% "PasswordTest2" /u:admin@cloudarchitecture.io`
     - ...
