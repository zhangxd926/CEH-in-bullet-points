# Scanning networks overview

- Process of obtaining additional information about hosts, ports and services in network
- More detailed reconnaissance
- Purpose is to identify vulnerabilities in communication channels and then create an attack plan.
- Different techniques are used to identify hosts, ports, and services in the target network.
- Used by administrators to verify security policies, monitoring uptime etc.
- Can craft custom packets using different tools
  - E.g. [Colasoft Packet Builder](http://www.colasoft.com), [NetScanTools Pro](https://www.netscantools.com), [Packeth](http://packeth.sourceforge.net)

## Scanning types

- **Port scanning**: to list open ports and services
- **Network scanning**: to list IP addresses
- **Vulnerability scanning**: to discover the presence of known vulnerabilities

## Scanning in IPv6 Networks

- IP supports more addresses
  - Bigger search space
  - More difficult and complex than IPv4
  - Harder to do ping sweeps
- Supports large number of hosts in a subnet.
  - Probing takes longer time
- üí° Attacker should find addresses from logs, e-mails, traffics etc. to identify addresses.

## Common ports to scan

- üìù List of TCP and UDP port numbers

  | Port | Protocol | Service |
  | ---- |:--------:| ------- |
  | 21 | TCP | [FTP (File Transfer Protocol)](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ftp-file-transfer-protocol) |
  | 22 | TCP | [SSH (Secure Shell)](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell) |
  | 23 | TCP | [Telnet](banner-grabbing.md#telnet) |

## Drawing and mapping out network topologies

- Useful for identifying and understanding the topology of the target network.
  - The diagram can tell the attacker how firewalls, IDSes, routers, and other devices are arranged in the network
- Information can be used for vulnerability discovery and exploit.
- A popular tool is *`zenmap`*: A GUI for [`nmap`](./scanning-tools.md#nmap)
  - ![zenmap screenshot](img/zenmap.png)
- E.g. scanning network in a coffee shop. Run `ipconfig` (windows) to get private IP address and subnet range. Then you can scan and create a map.
# TCP/IP

## TCP connection

### Three-way handshake

- Also known as ‚Ä¢¬†**3-way handshake** ‚Ä¢ **three-way handshake** ‚Ä¢ **3 way handshake** ‚Ä¢ **three way handshake**
- Establishes a TCP connection
- üìù Sender: `SYN` ‚Üí Receiver: `SYN ACK` ‚Üí Sender: `ACK`
  - ![Three Way Handshake (TCP)](img/three-way-handshake-tcp.png)
- `ACK` is then set in every packet sent after the handshake

### Termination

- üìù Sender: `FIN` ‚Üí Receiver: `ACK FIN` ‚Üí Sender: `ACK`

## IPv4

- IPv4 loopback address (localhost of your own machine) is `127.0.0.1`

### IPv4 address types

1. **Unicast**
   - Acted on by a single recipient
2. **Multicast**
   - Acted on only by members of a specific group
3. **Broadcast**
   - Acted on by everyone in the network
   - Two types:
     - **Limited broadcast**
       - Delivered to every system inside a domain using:
         - IP: 255.255.255.255
         - MAC: FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
       - Ignored by routers
     - **Directed broadcasts**
       - Sent to all devices on subnet
       - Use subnets broadcast address
         - E.g. if subnet is 192.168.17.0/24 then it uses 192.168.17.255
       - Routers may take action on the packets.

## IPv6

- IPv6 uses a 128-bit address instead of the 32-bit IPv4 version
- Represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons
  - E.g. `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
- Leading zeros can be removed e.g.
  - Original: `2001:0001:0002:0003:0004:0005:0006:0007`
  - Short: `2001:1:2:3:4:5:6:7`
- The loopback address is `::1`
  - Shortened version of `0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001`

## CIDR

- Method of the representing IP addresses
- üìù Easy way to find out CIDR ranges, remember: `/24 255.255.255.0 256`
  - So `/24` gives 256 IP addresses, `/25` gives 128, `/26` gives 64 and so on.
- IPv4 Notation

  | CIDR Range |¬†Total IP Addresses |¬†Subnet mask |
  | ---------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
  |¬†`/32` | 0 | `255.255` |
  | `/30` | 4 | `.225.252` |
  | `/28` | 16 | `.255.240` |
  | `/26` | 64 | `.255.192` |
  | `/24` | 256 | `.255.0` |
  | `/22` | 1024 | `.248.0` |
  | `/20` | 4096 | `.240.0` |

## TCP flags

- Used to indicate a particular connection state or provide additional information
- Size of each flag is 1 bit being either `0` or `1`
- üìù Flag types
  - **Synchronization (`SYN`)**
    - Also known as **synchronization** flag.
    - Synchronize sequence numbers
    - First step of connection establishment (3-way handshake)
    - ‚ùó Only the first packet sent from each end should have this flag set
  - **Acknowledgement (`ACK`)**
    - Confirms successful packet retrieval
  - **Push (`PSH`)**
    - Tells receiver to process packets instead of buffering them
  - **Urgent (`URG`)**
    - Process packets directly before others, even if they're not complete
  - **Finish (`FIN`)**:
    - `1` indicate connection termination requests
    - Used in the last packet sent from the sender.
  - **Reset (`RST`)**
    - `1` aborts the connection in response
    - Sent from the receiver to the sender when a packet is sent to a particular host that was not expecting it.
    - Also used as
      - DDoS attack, see [`RST` attack](./../13-web-applications/denial-of-service.md#rst-attack)
      - Scanning technique, see [RFC 793 scans](./scanning-techniques.md#rfc-793-scans)

### Finish (`FIN`) vs Reset (`RST`)

| `FIN` |¬†`RST` |
| ----- | ----- |
| Gracefully termination | Sudden termination |
| Only one side of conversation is stopped | Whole conversation is stopped |
| No data loss |¬†Data is discarded |
| Receiver of `FIN` can choose to continue communicating | Receiver has to stop communication |

### Push (`PSH`) vs Urgent (`URG`)

| `PSH` | `URG` |
| ----- | ----- |
| All data in buffer are pushed | Only urgent data is pushed immediately |
| Data is delivered in sequence |¬†Data is delivered out of sequence |

## TCP/IP sessions

- TCP uses stateful sessions
- Connection establishment must be done before data transfer
- **Session initiation**
  1. Source sends SYN packet
  2. Destination responds with SYN/ACK packet
  3. Source sends ACK packet
  - Connection stays open until closed with `FIN` or `RST` packets.
- Session termination

## OSI model

- Conceptual model that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions
- üìù Uses seven abstraction layers:
  1. **Physical** (bits)
     - Media, signal & binary transmission
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ Cables (fiber) ‚Ä¢ Fiber ‚Ä¢ Wireless ‚Ä¢ Hubs ‚Ä¢ Repeaters
  2. **Data link** (frames)
     - Physical addressing: MAC & LLC
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ Ethernet ‚Ä¢ [PPP](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ppp-point-to-point-protocol) ‚Ä¢ Switch ‚Ä¢ Bridge
  3. **Network** (packets)
     - Path determination & IP
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢¬†IP ‚Ä¢ [ICMP](./scanning-techniques.md#scanning-icmp) ‚Ä¢ [IPSec](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ipsec) ‚Ä¢ IGMP
  4. **Transport** (segments)
     - End-to-end connections and reliability
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ TCP ‚Ä¢ UDP
  5. **Session** (data)
     - Sync & send to ports, inter-host communication
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ API's ‚Ä¢ Sockets ‚Ä¢ WinSock
  6. **Presentation** (data)
     - Syntax layer
     - Encrypts/decrypts if needed
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ [SSL/TLS](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ssltls) (not entirely) ‚Ä¢ [SSH](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell)  ‚Ä¢ IMAP ‚Ä¢ [FTP](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ftp-file-transfer-protocol) ‚Ä¢ MPEG ‚Ä¢ JPEG
  7. **Application** (data)
     - End User Layer: network process to application
     - E.g. ‚Ä¢ HTTP ‚Ä¢ [FTP](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ftp-file-transfer-protocol) ‚Ä¢ IRC ‚Ä¢ [SSH](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell) ‚Ä¢ [DNS](./../04-enumeration/dns-enumeration.md#dns) ‚Ä¢ [SMTP](./../04-enumeration/enumeration-overview.md#smtp)
- See also ‚Ä¢ [Firewall types per OSI Layer |¬†Firewall](./../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/firewall-overview.md#firewall-types-per-osi-layer) ‚Ä¢¬†[Vulnerability stack |¬†Hacking web applications](./../13-web-applications/hacking-web-applications.md#vulnerability-stack) ‚Ä¢¬†[Encryption types per OSI layer |¬†Encryption algorithms](./../15-cryptography/encryption-algorithms.md#encryption-types-per-osi-layer)

## TCP/IP model

- TCP/IP model defines four levels:
  1. **Link layer**: ‚Ä¢ [ARP](./../08-sniffing/arp-poisoning.md#arp) ‚Ä¢ [PPP](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ppp-point-to-point-protocol) ‚Ä¢ [MAC](./../08-sniffing/sniffing-attacks-overview.md#mac)
  2. **Internet layer**: ‚Ä¢ TCP ‚Ä¢ UDP ‚Ä¢ DCCP ‚Ä¢ SCTP ...
  3. **Transport layer**: ‚Ä¢ IP ‚Ä¢ ICMP ‚Ä¢ ECN ‚Ä¢ [IPSec](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ipsec) ...
  4. **Application layer**: ‚Ä¢ [DNS](./../04-enumeration/dns-enumeration.md#dns) ‚Ä¢ HTTP ‚Ä¢¬†HTTPS ‚Ä¢ [FTP](./../15-cryptography/encrypting-communication.md#ftp-file-transfer-protocol) ‚Ä¢ [SSH](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell)) ‚Ä¢ SMTP ...
- ‚ùó OSI model does not match well TCP/IP
  - [RFC 3439](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3439) considers layering "harmful"
- ‚ùó E.g. SSL/TLS does not fit in any of OSI or TCP/IP layers
  - In OSI it's in layer 6 or 7, and, at the same time, in layer 4 or below.
  - In TCP/IP it's in between the transport and the application layers.

# Scanning tools

## Nmap

- Scans network by sending specially crafted packets
- Allows finding hosts on network with service, OS and firewall information
- Allows custom scripts written in LUA using **NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine)**
  - üí° Can be used to detect and/or exploit vulnerabilities
  - E.g. can [detect shellshock using nmap scripting engine](./../05-vulnerabilities/common-vulnerabilities.md#detecting-shellshock-using-nmap)
- Includes
  - [Ncat](https://Nmap.org/ncat/): reads and writes data across networks from the command
  - [`ndiff`](https://Nmap.org/ndiff/): compares scan results
  - [`nping`](https://Nmap.org/nping/): generates packets and analyzes responses
- ü§ó Used often in movies including Matrix Reloaded, see [the list](https://nmap.org/movies/)
- See also [Nmap | Network footprinting](./../02-footprinting/network-footprinting.md#nmap) and [Nmap | Vulnerability analysis](./../05-vulnerabilities/vulnerability-analysis.md#nmap).

### [Phases of an Nmap scan](https://Nmap.org/book/Nmap-phases.html)

1. **Script pre-scanning**: Runs NSE scripts that are run once per execution for each targets, e.g. `dhcp-discover`.
2. **Target enumeration**: Resolves DNS names, CIDR network notations etc. to list of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
3. **Host discovery (ping scanning)**: Checking if a host (or which hosts are) is alive before deeper investigation
4. **Reverse-DNS resolution**: Provides IP numbers for hosts that are alive
5. **Port scanning**: Probes are sent and remote port states are classified as `open`, `closed`, `filtered`
6. **Version detection**: Determines what server software is running on remote system
7. **OS detection**: Determines OS that's running on the port
8. **Traceroute**: Usually involves another round of reverse-DNS resolution for intermediate hosts.
9. **Script scanning**: Runs most of the scripts rather than pre-scan and post-scan phases.
10. **Output**: Prints results using different options e.g. XML
11. **Script post-scanning**: Runs scripts that process results and deliver final reports and statistics

### Common Nmap options

- üìù All options are important for a security tester to be able to use Nmap.
- `-n` (no resolution): Skips DNS resolution and scanning for DNS addresses
- `-A`: Enable ‚Ä¢ OS detection ‚Ä¢ version detection ‚Ä¢ script scanning ‚Ä¢ traceroute
- `--traceroute`: Enables trace routing
- `--script` or `-SC`: Activates custom script scanning

#### `-s*`: port scan options

- Uses [ICMP echo request](./scanning-techniques.md#scanning-icmp), [TCP SYN](./scanning-techniques.md#syn-scanning) to port 443, [TCP ACK to port 80](./scanning-techniques.md#ack-scanning), and an ICMP timestamp request.
- `-sn`
  - Also known as ***ping scan*** or ***host discovery***
  - Skips port scanning
- Common commands include:
  - TCP port scanning: `-sS` ([SYN](./scanning-techniques.md#syn-scanning)), `-sT` ([connect](./scanning-techniques.md#tcp-connect)), `-sN` ([NULL](./scanning-techniques.md#null-scan)), `-sF` ([FIN](./scanning-techniques.md#fin-scan)), `-sX` ([XMAS](./scanning-techniques.md#xmas-scan))
  - UDP port scanning: `-sU` ([UDP](./scanning-techniques.md#udp-scanning))
  - `-sV`: service/version detection scan
  - `-sO`
    - IP protocol scan
    - Not really a port scan
    - Lists supported IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP etc.) by target system.

#### `-P*`: ping (host discovery) options

- `-P*` options are used to select different ping methods
- User with `-sn` to skip port scanning and do host discovery only.
- Common commands include:
  - TCP: `-PS`, ([SYN](./scanning-techniques.md#syn-scanning)), `-PA` ([ACK](./scanning-techniques.md#ack-scanning))
  - Others: `-PR` ([ARP](./scanning-techniques.md#arp-scan)), `-PO` (IP protocol ping), `-PE` [ICMP](./scanning-techniques.md#icmp-ping-sweep) `PU` ([UDP](./scanning-techniques.md#udp-scanning))
  - **`-Pn` (no ping)**
    - Also known as ***pingless scan*** or ***port scan***
    - Skips host discovery and treats all hosts as online

#### Specifying ports

- `-p-` to scan all ports (`1-65535`)
- `-p`: only scan specified ports
  - E.g. `-p U:53,111,137,T:21-25,80,139,8080`
- `-r`: Scan ports consecutively - don't randomize

#### `-O`: OS fingerprinting

- `-O` is used for operating system fingerprinting
- It's Far more effective if at least one open and one closed TCP port are found.
  - Flag with `--osscan-limit` and Nmap will not try OS detection against hosts that do not meet this criteria.
- `--fuzzy` or `--osscan-guess` switch: Nmap will guess more aggressively
- ‚ùóRequires `sudo` privileges
- See also [banner grabbing](./banner-grabbing.md)

#### `-o*`: output options

- `-oX` for XML output.
- `-oG` for `grep`able output to be able to use linux [`grep` command](../06-system-hacking/linux-basics.md) to search in text
- ‚ùó Not to be confused with `-O` (OS fingerprinting)

#### Faster scans

- `-T*`: Timing template
  - From slowest to fastest: `-T0` (paranoid), `-T1` (sneaky), `-T2` (polite), `-T3` (normal | default), `-T4` (aggressive) or `-T5` (insane)
- `-F`: Fast (limited port) scan
  - Nmap as default most common 1000 ports, `-F` reduces it to 100
- ‚ùó If the scan is too fast the system can drop the packets
  - Risky because the system can cancel the whole scan when it detects for the first time.

#### Target specification

- `nmap <target>`
- Everything that isn't an option (or option argument) is treated as a target host specification
- Target can be IP address(es) or hostname(s) (resolved via DNS)
- Target can be specify single or multiple hosts:
  - Scanning single host:
    - E.g. `nmap 192.168.10.0` (IP address) or `nmap localhost` (hostname)
  - Scanning many hosts:
    - CIDR style addressing
      - E.g. `192.168.10.0/24` would scan the 256 hosts
    - Octet range addressing (more flexible)
      - E.g. `192.168.0-255.1-254`
      - Full octet scan: `192.168.0.*`
    - Using target list: `nmap -iL targets`
    - Scan multiple addresses using `nmap <target-1>, <target-2> ...`
      - E.g. `nmap privacy.sexy cloudarchitecture.io`

## Hping

- [Open-source](http://www.hping.org/) port scanner
- Sends custom ICMP, UDP, or TCP packets and then displays any replies

### Hping vs Nmap

- `nmap` can scan a range of IP addresses
  - `hping` can only port scan one individual IP address
- `hping` is more lower level and stealthier than `nmap`
- `hping` does not support IPv6 while `nmap` does.

### Common hping commands

- `--tcp-timestamp`
  - Enables TCP timestamps
  - Tries to guess the timestamp update frequency and the remote system uptime.
  - ‚ùó Many firewalls drop packets without timestamp.
- `-Q` or `--seqnum`
  - Collects sequence numbers generated by target host
  - Useful when you need to analyze whether TCP sequence number is predictable.
- Setting flags using
  - `-F` (`FIN`), `-S` (`SYN`), `-R` (`RST`), `-P` (`PUSH`), `-A` (`ACK`), `-U` (`URG`)
- Scanning entire subnet: `hping3 -1 10.0.1.x`
- Listen to traffic (e.g. to sniff): `hping3 -9 HTTP -I eth0`
- See also its [man page](https://linux.die.net/man/8/hping3)

## Mobile tools

- [IP Scanner](https://10base-t.com) for IOS
- [Fing](https://www.fing.io) for IOS and Android
# Scanning techniques

- Used to
  - Identify open ports also i.e. **port scanning**
  - Identify which hosts or are alive i.e. **host discovery**
- Same techniques can be used for both port scanning and host scanning
  - But can require different tools or commands
  - See: Nmap [port scanning](./scanning-tools.md#-s-port-scan-options) vs [host discovery](./scanning-tools.md#-p-ping-host-discovery-options) commands

## Techniques per protocol

### Scanning ICMP

- Also called **ping scan** or **ICMP scan**
- Typically used for checking if a host is alive or has errors
- üí° üìù It saves time before running a port scan
- ‚ùó Often incoming ICMP requests are disabled by firewalls.
- On Network Layer 3, so does not have port abstraction like TCP/UDP (Transport layer 4)
- In Nmap, ping commands start with `-P*` e.g. `-PE` for `ICMP Echo`
- **Round-trip time**
  - Time it takes for a packet to make a complete trip
- If blocked, usually returns no response or sometimes ICMP errors such as type 3 code 13 (destination unreachable: communication administratively prohibited)

#### Broadcast ICMP ping

- Sends packet to every possible address on the network
- E.g. `ping -b 192.168.135.255` (subnet broadcast)
  - Pings to `192.168.129.19`, `192.168.129.20`, `192.168.129.21`...
  - Or all broadcast through `ping -b 192.168.129.255`
    - Alive hosts will populate local arp table, can be seen using `arp -a`
- Usually discarded and a useless method
- See also [Smurf attack |¬†Denial of Service](./../13-web-applications/denial-of-service.md#smurf-attack)

#### ICMP ping packet types

- **Echo**
  - Sends `ICMP ECHO` (type 8) expecting `ICMP ECHO` reply
  - Also known as ***ICMP echo scanning*** or [***ICMP ping sweep***](#icmp-ping-sweep)
  - üìù **Tools**
    - Nmap: `-PE`
    - hping: `hping3 -1 <target>`
- **Timestamp**
  - Sends `ICMP TIMESTAMP` (type 13)
  - **Tools**
    - Nmap: `-PP`
    - hping: `hping3 -1 <target> --icmptype 13`
- **Address mask**
  - Sends `ICMP ADDRESS MASK` (type 17)
  - Tools
    - Nmap: `-PM`
    - hping: `hping3 -1 <target> --icmptype 17`

#### ICMP ping sweep

- Also called **ICMP sweep** or **ICMP echo scanning**
- üìù Used to determine active hosts in target network range.
- Tools include
  - [Angry ip](https://angryip.org/)
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/host-discovery-techniques.html): `nmap -sn 192.168.0.*`
    - or `nmap -sn <ip-address>/<subnet-range>`
    - or `nmap -sn 192.168.0.1-30` to scan e.g. between `1-30` in last octet
    - `-sn`: (optional) skip port scan

### Scanning TCP

#### TCP connect

- Also known as **full open scan** or **TCP Connect() scan**
- Used for detecting open ports upon the completion of the three-way handshake.
- Works by establishing a full connection and then dropping it by sending a RST packet.
  - ![TCP connect scan](img/tcp-connect.png)
- **Pros**
  - üìù Accurate, most reliable
  - Requires no additional user privileges
  - Allows scanning behind a firewall.
- **Cons**
  - üìù Easily detectable by IDSes and logged
- üí° Use [SYN](#syn-scanning) which would be faster and stealthier
- Tools
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-connect-scan.html): `nmap -sT <ip-or-host>`

#### SYN scanning

- üìù Also known as ***TCP SYN ping***, ***SYN stealth***, ***stealth scan***, ***half-open scan*** or ***TCP ping*** scan
- Default and most popular scan
- Works by resetting the TCP connection before the three-way handshake is completed, which in turn makes the connection half open.
  - ![SYN scanning flow](img/syn-scan.png)
- **Pros**
  - Fast
  - Reliable
  - Works on any compliant TCP stack
  - Stealthy because it never completes TCP connections (can bypass firewalls and logging)
- **Cons**
  - Require root privileges
  - Rulesets block many SYN scan attempts
- Tools
  - üìù [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/synscan.html): `-PS` (host discovery) or `-sS` (port scan)
  - Hping: `hping3 -8 <port-list e.g. 50-60> ‚ÄìS <ip-address> ‚ÄìV`

#### RFC 793 scans

- üìù According to [RFC 793](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793.txt), any packet not containing `SYN`, `RST`, or `ACK` bits will result in
  - `RST` if the port is closed
  - no response the port is open
- Works by sending TCP probe packets with or without `SYN`, `RST`, `ACK` flags.
- **Pros**
  - Very stealthy (more than [SYN](#syn-scanning)) against IDS and logging systems
  - Avoids TCP three-way handshake
- **Cons**
  - Require root privileges
  - Unreliable (false positives) against systems does not follow the RFC
    - Unix-only
    - Ineffective against Windows and many IBM/Cisco devices
- ü§ó Using Nmap, one could utilize `--scanflags` to test with permutations of each case (total: 8) to check for `RST` response, but there are easier ways for most popular combinations: ‚Ä¢ [XMAS](#xmas-scan) ‚Ä¢ [NULL scan](#null-scan) ‚Ä¢¬†[FIN scan](#fin-scan)

##### XMAS Scan

- üìù Works by sending a TCP frame with `FIN`, `URG`, and `PUSH` flags set.
- ü§ó **Christmas tree packet**: packet with every option set, like bulbs on a Christmas tree
- ![XMAS scan response interpretation](img/xmas-scan.png)
- Tools
  - Hping: `hping3 -F -P -U <ip-address> -p <port-number>`
    - `-F` for `FIN`, `-P` for `PUSH`), `-U` for `URG`
  - üìù [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html): `-sX`'

##### Inverse TCP flag scan

- An inverse TCP scan has `PSH` or `URG` or `FIN` or none flag set, i.e. a single flag or no flag.
- As opposed to [XMAS](#xmas-scan) that sets `PSH` and `URG` and `FIN`, i.e. all three flags at once

###### NULL Scan

- Also known as ***NULL probe***
- Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)
- [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html): `-sN`

###### FIN Scan

- Also known as ***FIN probe***
- Sets just the TCP FIN bit.
- [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-null-fin-xmas-scan.html): `-sF`

#### ACK scanning

- Also known as ***ACK flag scanning***, ***ACK flag probe scanning*** or ***TCP ACK scan***
- Used to detect existence of firewalls, cannot detect open ports
- Works by sending TCP packet with `ACK` flag set.
  - `ACK` (acknowledgment) is used to acknowledge the successful receipt of a packet
  - ![TCP ACK Scan](img/ack-scan.png)
- **Pros**
  - Difficult to log, avoids IDS detection
  - Helps detecting existence of stateful firewalls
    - As they would not allow `ACK` without `SYN`, see [TCP sessions](./tcpip-basics.md#tcpip-sessions)
- **Disadvantages**
  - Relies on BSD network code bug in older versions
  - Slow
- **Tools**
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-ack-scan.html): `-PA` (host discovery) or `-sA` (port scan)
  - Hping: `hping3 ‚ÄìA <ip-address> ‚Äìp <port>`

##### ACK Classification

- Two fields are inspected to classify `RST` response: `WINDOW` and `TTL`
- **`TTL`**
  - It's open if TTL has less than `64` while others have higher values

    ```txt
      packet 1: host X.X.X.X port 20: F:RST -> ttl: 70 win: 0 => closed
      packet 2: host X.X.X.X port 21: F:RST -> ttl: 70 win: 0 => closed
      packet 3: host X.X.X.X port 22: F:RST -> ttl: 40 win: 0 => open
      packet 4: host X.X.X.X port 23: F:RST -> ttl: 70 win: 0 => closed
    ```

- **`WINDOW`**
  - It's open if it has non-zero value.
  - Works for older BSD and UNIX but has been patched

  ```txt
    packet 1: host X.X.X.X port 20: F:RST -> ttl: 64 win: 0 => closed
    packet 2: host X.X.X.X port 21: F:RST -> ttl: 64 win: 0 => closed
    packet 3: host X.X.X.X port 22: F:RST -> ttl: 64 win: 512 => open
    packet 4: host X.X.X.X port 23: F:RST -> ttl: 64 win: 0 => closed
  ```

#### IDLE scan

- Also known as ***TCP Idle Scan***, ***IDLE header scan***, ***header scan***, ***IDLE/IPID scan***
- Allows for blind port scanning (without sending any packet with own IP)
- Utilizes IP address of a zombie machine through spoofed packets
- ü§ó Found by author of [hping2](./scanning-tools.md#hping) tool
- üìù Flow
  1. Probe the zombie's IP ID and record it.
     - **IP ID**
       - Every IP packet on the Internet has a fragment identification number
       - Incremented by OSes for each packet sent
     - Zombie should be
       - idle as no other traffic would increase the traffic
       - assigning IP ID packets incrementally on global level instead of per-host basis.
  2. Forge a `SYN` packet from the zombie and send it to the desired port on the target.
  3. Probe the zombie's IP ID again.
     - If it's increased compared to one in step 1, port is open (it has received)
- **Pros**
  - Ultimate stealth scan as attackers IP would not be revealed
  - Can be used for framing as IDS will report zombie as the attacker
- **Cons**  
  - It takes far longer
  - Many ISPs implement egress filtering to prevent the packet spoofing
- **Tools**
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/idlescan.html): `nmap -Pn -sI <zombie-ip/domain> <target-ip/domain>`
    - üìù `-sI`: Idle scan
    - `-Pn`: no ping to be stealthy

### Scanning UDP

- Connectionless stream protocol, so no handshakes
- UDP is used by e.g. DNS (port 53), SNMP (port 161/162), and DHCP (port 67/68)

#### UDP Scanning

- Also known as ***UDP ping***, ***UDP/ICMP error scan***, ***UDP port scan*** or ***UDP ICMP_PORT_UNREACHABLE scan***
- Exploits UDP behavior where the receiver sends an ICMP packet with error code when a port is unreachable.
- No response is interpreted as "open" or "filtered" behind firewall
- **Pros**
  - Avoids TCP IDS
  - Scans non-TCP ports that are quite common
- **Cons**
  - Provides port information only
  - ICMP is rate-limited by Linux kernel however not by Windows
  - Require root privileges
  - Slower and more difficult than TCP
- **Tools**
  - Hping: `hping3 -2 <ip-address> ‚Äìp <port>`
  - üìù [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/scan-methods-udp-scan.html): : `-PU` (host discovery) or `-sU` (port scan)

## Other techniques

### List Scanning

- Performing a reverse DNS resolution to identify the names of the hosts.
- No packets are sent to hosts
- **Pros**
  - Sanity check to ensure that target IP addresses are proper
  - Stealthy, unobtrusive, does not trigger IDS alerts
- Tools
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/host-discovery-controls.html): `nmap -sL <ip-address>`

### SSDP Scanning

- Used to detect UPnP vulnerabilities and carry out buffer overflow or DoS attacks
- **SSDP**
  - Simple Service Discovery Protocol
  - Network protocol based on for discovery of devices on same network
  - Basis of UPnP (Universal Plug and Play) protocol
- Steps:
  1. Attacker discovers networked devices and create a list of all the devices that respond.
  2. Attacker creates a UDP packet with the spoofed IP address of the targeted victim.
  3. Attacker then uses a botnet to send a spoofed discovery packet to each plug-and-play device
  4. Each device will send a reply to the targeted victim with an amount of data up to about 30 times larger than the attacker's request.
  5. The target then receives a large volume of traffic from all the devices and becomes overwhelmed, potentially resulting in denial-of-service to legitimate traffic
- Tools
  - [Metasploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/auxiliary/scanner/upnp/ssdp_msearch.rb): `use auxiliary/scanner/upnp/ssdp_msearch`

### ARP Scan

- Useful when scanning an ethernet LAN
- **ARP**: Regular ARP packet request looks for the MAC address using the device's IP address.
- Tools
  - `nping`: Learn router MAC address: `nping --arp-type ARP <router-ip-address>`
  - [`nmap`](https://Nmap.org/book/host-discovery-techniques.html): `nmap -sn -PR 192.168.0.*`
    - `-PR`: ARP discovery
    - `-sn`: skip port scan

## Countermeasures

- Configuring firewall and IDS to detect and block scans
- Protecting mechanisms for filtering and routing from being bypassed using certain ports
- Updating the router, IDS, and firewall
- Keeping as few ports open as necessary and filtering the rest
- Checking the configuration of the network and its ports
- Ensuring the proper configuration of anti- scanning and spoofing rulesets
# Bypassing IDS and firewall

- Read more on [Intrusion Detection System Detection | Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/subvert-ids.html#avoid-ids)
- See also ‚Ä¢ [Evading IDS](../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/evading-ids.md) and [Evading Firewalls](../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/evading-firewalls.md)

## Packet fragmentation

- Also known as ***IP fragment scanning*** or ***IP fragmentation***
- üìù Splitting up TCP header to several smaller (fragmented) packets when sending
- Server then reassembles them once all packets are received.
- Usually ignored by IDSes as processing them requires a lot of computer resources
- Any IP datagram can be fragmented: including UDP, TCP, ICMP, etc.
- See also [session splicing](./../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/evading-ids.md#session-splicing) for HTTP header variant.
- Tools
  - [Nmap](https://Nmap.org/book/man-bypass-firewalls-ids.html):  `-f` flag e.g. `nmap -f <ip-or-host>`
    - splits the packets into 8 bytes or less after the IP header
    - Alternatively can use `--mtu` option allows to set bytes e.g. `--mtu 16`
  - [`fragroute`](https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/fragroute)
    - Usage: `fragroute <domain-name>`
    - Intercept, modify, and rewrite egress traffic to use fragments

## Source routing

- Also called ***path addressing***
- Specifying which path the malformed packet will take to get to the target host.
- Used to skip routes (routers/gateways) where firewalls exist
  - Disregards what route tables say
- ‚ùó Almost always blocked
- Done by modifying IP address field in IP Options field
  - ![IP datagram](img/ip-datagram.png)
- Using Nmap:
  - **Loose routing**
    - Specifying packet to be loose source routed through given IP way points
    - E.g. `--ip-options "L 192.168.0.7 192.168.30.9"`
  - **Strict routing**
    - You will have to specify every single hop along the path.
    - E.g.  `--ip-options "S 192.168.0.7 192.168.0.9 .. 192.168.30.9"`
- See also [IP address spoofing through source routing |¬†Session hijacking](../13-web-applications/session-hijacking.md#ip-address-spoofing-using-source-routing).

## IP address decoy

- Also known as ***decoy scan***
- All packets originate from the scanning machine, but some have spoofed source addresses.
- **Pros**: Helps to confuse port scan detection
- **Cons**
  - Does not offer any information beyond a regular scan.
  - Slows down the scanning process
- Using Nmap:
  - `nmap -D decoy1,decoy2,ME,decoy3... <target>`: Manual list with custom positioned `ME`
  - or `nmap -D RND:10 <target>` to randomize 10 decoy IP addresses

## IP address spoofing

- Used to make packet appear to come from someone else
- Done by changing address information in IP packet header field
- Replies go back to the spoofed address not to the attacker
- Mostly used for DoS attacks
- Tools:
  - hping: `hping3 <target> -a <spoofed-ip>`
  - Nmap: `nmap <target> -S <spoofed-ip>`

### IP address spoofing detection techniques

- **Direct TTL probes**
  - Ping to suspect IP
  - If `TTL` in reply is not same as suspect packet, it may be spoofed
- **IP Identification Number**
  - Ping to suspect IP
  - `IPID` should be close to but higher than suspect packet
  - OS increases IP incrementally for each packet sent
- **TCP Flow Control Method**
  - **Sliding window protocol**
    - In TCP, for each packet `ACK` is expected back before sending another packet.
    - *Window* packets are allowed to be sent without having to wait for an ACK.
    - Allows packets to arrive out of order
    - Window size field in TCP header
      - Tells maximum amount of data sender can transmit without waiting for `ACK`
      - **Windows update packet** is used to negotiate a different window size.
  - Attacker that uses spoof IPs do not receive window size information
  - If victims receives data packets beyond the window size, they are spoofed packets

### IP address spoofing countermeasures

- Use encryption
  - Best prevention against IP spoofing attacks
- Avoid trust relationships
  - Also known as **no trust architecture**
  - Do not rely on IP-based authentication
  - Test all packets, even when they come from one of your trusted hosts
  - E.g. through password authentication, OAuth etc.
- Use firewalls and filtering mechanisms
- Use random initial sequence numbers (ISN)
  - As `SYN` is `ISN+1` it allows malicious connections.
  - E.g. if it's based on timed counter it's predictable
- Ingress filtering
  - Blocking incoming traffic based [access control lists (ACLs)](./../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/firewall-overview.md#access-control-lists-acls)
  - Good against blocking unauthorized access
- Egress filtering against insider attacks
  - Blocking outcoming traffic
  - Good against insider attacks where e.g. malware can send information
- [SYN flooding countermeasures](./../13-web-applications/denial-of-service.md#syn-flood-countermeasures)

## Encryption

- üìù Encryption over e.g. SSL/TLS or SSH is a good evasion as it "cripples" payload inspection.
- One way to be able to inspect is through **MITM attacks**
  1. The server-side encryption is terminated at the inspecting firewall
  2. The firewall re-encrypts the client-side connection and passes data in between.
- Other solution is to use **Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)**
  - It focuses more on unencrypted metadata rather than encrypted payload.
  - It uses behavioral analysis to sort through network traffic and identify dangerous or suspicious traffic based on what the traffic/host does on the network.

## Proxy servers

- Acts as an intermediary for requests from clients and servers
- `client <--> proxy <--> server`
- You can use [free public proxies](http://freeproxylists.net/) for educational purposes
  - ‚ùó Careful with public proxies as they can be malicious e.g. inject stuff into your traffic.
  - üí° Have your own proxies set-up, see [steps for creating a proxy server](./../11-firewalls-ids-and-honeypots/honeypot.md#setting-up-a-proxy-server-as-honeypot)

### Usage by defenders

- As a firewall to protect internal network
- As a IP address multiplexer hiding IP addresses of internal servers.
- Anonymize web surfing to some extend e.g. with VPN services or [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/)
  - Mobile tools include [Shadowsocks](https://shadowsocks.org/en/index.html) (cross-platform sock5 proxy), [proxydroid](https://github.com/madeye/proxydroid) (http / sock4 / sock5 on Android)
- Filtering unwanted content such as ads
- Save bandwidth on local networks

### Usage by attackers

- To conceal the real source of the scan.
- To remotely access intranets/corporate resources using victim as proxy
- To do man-in-the-middle attacks by redirecting user traffic to the proxy
- To sniff user data
- Tools include
  - [Parox proxy](https://tools.kali.org/13-web-applications/paros) (outdated), or updated fork of it: [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/)

#### Proxy chaining

- Helps to increase anonymity by using two or more proxies in chain:
  - like `your_host <--> proxy1 <--> proxy2 <--> target_host`

##### ProxyChains

- üìù [Open source](https://github.com/rofl0r/proxychains-ng) unix tool to setup a proxy.
- Download a file using e.g. `proxychains4 wget <fileurl>`
- Configure through its configuration file `vim /etc/proxychains.conf`
  - E.g.

    ```txt
      sock4 127.0.0.1 9050
      http 159.65.133.175 3128
      http 50.198.134.65 80
    ```

### Anonymizer

- Proxy server that acts as an intermediary and privacy shield between a client computer and Internet provider
- Use-cases include
  - Bypassing internet censors
  - Ensuring privacy
  - Having protection against online attacks
  - Bypassing IDS and firewall rules (of e.g. companies or schools)

#### Types of anonymizers

- Networked anonymizers
  - Information is transferred through network of computers
  - **Pros**: Harder to analyze traffic
  - **Cons**: Nodes in the sequence can be compromised
- Single-point anonymizers
  - Information is transferred through single website
  - **Pros**: Protects IP and related information
  - **Cons**: Less resistance to sophisticated analysis

#### Anonymizer tools

- OS
  - [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/): Live OS to protect against surveillance and censorship
  - [Whonix](https://www.whonix.org/): Designed to run in VMs to increase security and privacy
- Software
  - [Invisible Internet Project (I2P)](https://geti2p.net)
  - [TunnelBear](https://www.tunnelbear.com)
- Mobile apps
  - [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/): Proxy with Tor
  - [Psiphon](https://psiphon3.com/en/index.html): Tunnel through VPN on Android

##### Tor

- Free and open-source software for enabling anonymous communication
- üìù Stronger privacy than single [node proxies](#proxy-servers) or [proxy chains](#proxy-chaining) without encryption
- ‚ùó Anonymous as long as guard and exit nodes are not the same party and the traffic is over HTTPs
- VPN / Proxies (non-chained): Single point of failure
  - Provider knows who you are and what you browse
  - Provider may inject packets (e.g. ads) into traffic or record personal details.
- Tor traffic goes through at least 3 different servers (up to 5000) before destination
  - Provides separate encryption layer for each server
  - An observer cannot read or modify packets
  - Second server (middle relay) passes encrypted data without knowing more than its predecessor and descendant
  - Weaknesses
    - ‚ùó A bad first server (guard node) knows your IP but not what you sent or where.
    - ‚ùó A bad third server (exit node) sees your traffic but cannot know who sent the traffic.
      - ‚ùó Exit node can eavesdrop if the packet is not using HTTPS but HTTP
    - ‚ùó Will be no privacy if both the entry and exit nodes are hijacked by same hostile party.

##### I2P (Invisible Internet Project)

- Peer-to-peer alternative to [Tor](#tor)
- Each participant acts both as a client and as a router
# Banner grabbing

- **Banner information** = name + version
- üìù Used to gain banner information about
  - a computer (e.g. OS information)
  - the services running on its open ports (e.g. nginx server)
- Allows attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities and form an attack plan.
- Can be prevented by disabling banners and by hiding web page extensions.

## Passive banner grabbing

- Uses sniffing to determine the operating system.
- E.g. analyzing error messages, sniffing the traffic on the network, and examining page extensions.

## Active banner grabbing

- Sending a packet to the OS and then analyzing the responses.
- E.g. each OS have different TCP/IP stack implementations.
  - Values of TTL (time to live) and TCP window size in the IP header of the first packet are different in each OS.
- HTTP (80), FTP (21), SMTP (25) are common ports.
- Tools include `telnet`, [`nmap`](./scanning-tools.md#nmap), [`zgrap`](https://github.com/zmap/zgrab2) and `netcat`.

### Banner grabbing tools

- `nmap -O` for OS automatic fingerprinting, see also [`-O`: OS fingerprinting | Scanning tools](./scanning-tools.md#-o-os-fingerprinting)

#### Netcat

- Networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP
- ü§ó Also known as TCP/IP swiss army knife
- **FTP**
  - `nc 178.128.203.1 21`: Checks FTP port 21
    - üí° You can use `nmap 178.128.203.1` to find out open ports.
  - Usual for FTP servers to return something like `Welcome to XXX FTP Server`
    - gives you insights about the owner and that it's a FTP server
- **HTTP**
  - E.g.
    1. `nc 178.128.203.1 80`
    2. Type e.g. `GET /index.html HTTP 1.0` or `HEAD / HTTP/1.1`
    3. Press `[ENTER]`
  - And also usually useful headers such as `Server: Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS)`
- [CryptCat](http://cryptcat.sourceforge.net/) is the encrypted version of netcat

#### Telnet

- Application protocol for bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication using a virtual terminal connection
- Historically used to access to a command-line interface on a remote host but now replaced with [SSH](./../15-cryptography/tunneling-protocols.md#ssh-secure-shell) as it's unsecure.
- Built into many operative systems as default
- Runs on port 23 so `telnet <target>` sends TCP to targets port 23.
  - You can send to different ports using `telnet`
- If port is open a banner response received looking like:
  - `Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0 Date: Fri, 14 Aug 2009 1:14:42 GMT Content-Length:340 Content-Type: text/html`
